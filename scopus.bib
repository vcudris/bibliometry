	abstract = {Citizen science has been gaining popularity in ecological research and resource management in general and in urban forestry specifically. As municipalities and nonprofits engage volunteers in tree data collection, it is critical to understand data quality. We investigated observation error by comparing street tree data collected by experts to data collected by less experienced field crews in Lombard, IL; Grand Rapids, MI; Philadelphia, PA; and Malmö, Sweden. Participants occasionally missed trees (1.2%) or counted extra trees (1.0%). Participants were approximately 90% consistent with experts for site type, land use, dieback, and genus identification. Within correct genera, participants recorded species consistent with experts for 84.8% of trees. Mortality status was highly consistent (99.8% of live trees correctly reported as such), however, there were few standing dead trees overall to evaluate this issue. Crown transparency and wood condition had the poorest performance and participants expressed concerns with these variables; we conclude that these variables should be dropped from future citizen science projects. In measuring diameter at breast height (DBH), participants had challenges with multi-stemmed trees. For single-stem trees, DBH measured by participants matched expert values exactly for 20.2% of trees, within 0.254 cm for 54.4%, and within 2.54 cm for 93.3%. Participants’ DBH values were slightly larger than expert DBH on average (+0.33 cm), indicating systematic bias. Volunteer data collection may be a viable option for some urban forest management and research needs, particularly if genus-level identification and DBH at coarse precision are acceptable. To promote greater consistency among field crews, we suggest techniques to encourage consistent population counts, using simpler methods for multi-stemmed trees, providing more resources for species identification, and more photo examples for other variables. Citizen science urban forest inventory and monitoring projects should use data validation and quality assurance procedures to enhance and document data quality. © 2017},

These military urban forests have similarities and differences with urban forests in non-military communities, and their management is in some ways different. In this paper we describe the urban forest situation at Hill Air Force Base in northern Utah, an example of a military base still in the early stages of urban forest management, but with an improving and expanding urban forestry program. The base, in cooperation with Utah State University's Department of Forest Resources, began an assessment of its program and conducted a complete tree inventory in 1993. Inventory results and a qualitative assessment led to development of a plan with management goals and implementation strategies, which became part of an overall Natural Resources Management Plan for the Base. Besides increasing tree numbers and overall urban forest quality and tree management, the plan calls for increased emphasis on community participation as the key to a successful urban forestry program.},

	abstract = {Urban areas are continuously expanding today, extending their influence on an increasingly large proportion of woods and trees located in or nearby urban and urbanizing areas, the so-called urban forests. Although these forests have the potential for significantly improving the quality the urban environment and the well-being of the urban population, data to quantify the extent and characteristics of urban forests are still lacking or fragmentary on a large scale. In this regard, an expansion of the domain of multipurpose forest inventories like National Forest Inventories (NFIs) towards urban forests would be required. To this end, it would be convenient to exploit the same sampling scheme applied in NFIs to assess the basic features of urban forests. This paper considers approximately unbiased estimators of abundance and coverage of urban forests, together with estimators of the corresponding variances, which can be achieved from the first phase of most large-scale forest inventories. A simulation study is carried out in order to check the performance of the considered estimators under various situations involving the spatial distribution of the urban forests over the study area. An application is worked out on the data from the Italian NFI. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	abstract = {Eeffective management of the urban forest calls for municipalities to have a tree inventory of their urban resource. The approach to ur- effective ur-ban forestry is rather different in Europe and North America, both in terms of background and culture. This contribution discusses similarities and differences in tree inventory practices, based on a pilot study of three major cities in North America (Toronto, Ontario, Canada; and Boston, Massachusetts and New York City, New York, U.S.) and three major cities in Northern Europe (Oslo, Norway; and Aarhus and Copenhagen, Den-mark). The pilot study consisted of semi-structured expert interviews in each city, and an analysis of their tree inventories in terms of their level of detail, how they were undertaken, and how they have been used. Each of the cities, with exception of Oslo, had inventoried all of their street trees. Volunteers were only used in Boston and New York City. None of the cities had developed a management plan based on their tree in-ventory. The inventory had only been completely incorporated into the work order system in New York City and Toronto. This explorative study shows that more research is needed to investigate what subsequently happens to tree inventories in municipalities after they have been per-formed. Moreover, more work is needed to identify whether inventories are being utilized to their full advantage in terms of producing manage-ment plans. Some key themes for further research are described. The set up of this pilot study could serve as a format for comprehensive research. © 2012 International Society of Arboriculture.},

Information collected from each tree included diameter at breast height (DBH), tree height, crown width, percent dieback, and a tree condition rating. The complete inventory included 7,345 trees with Lagerstroemia spp. (crapemyrtle), Quercus phellos (willow oak), and Pinus taeda (loblolly pine) being the most numerous species on campus. Average DBH and total height of all trees were 16.4 cm and 8.5 m, respectively, with an estimated canopy cover of approximately 16%. Two tree condition ratings were recorded for each tree and results indicated that percent dieback alone is not a sufficient measure to evaluate tree condition.

Local practitioners have monitoring projects that have not been well documented in the urban forestry literature. To learn more about practitioner-driven monitoring efforts, the authors surveyed 32 local urban forestry organizations across the United States about the goals, challenges, methods, and uses of their monitoring programs, using an e-mailed questionnaire. Non-profit organizations, municipal agencies, state agencies, and utilities participated. One-half of the organizations had six or fewer urban forestry staff. Common goals for monitoring included evaluating the success of tree planting and management, taking a proactive approach towards tree care, and engaging communities. The most commonly recorded data were species, condition rating, mortality status, and diameter at breast height. Challenges included limited staff and funding, difficulties with data management and technology, and field crew training. Programs used monitoring results to inform tree planting and maintenance practices, provide feedback to individuals responsible for tree care, and manage tree risk. Participants emphasized the importance of planning ahead: carefully considering what data to collect, setting clear goals, developing an appropriate database, and planning for funding and staff time. To improve the quality and consistency of monitoring data across cities, researchers can develop standardized protocols and be responsive to practitioner needs and organizational capacities. © 2013 International Society of Arboriculture.},

Urban forest structure, function, and value were estimated from 184 stratified random sample plots. A total 48 tree species were encountered and the three most common that contributed 34.1% of total tree population were Polyalthia longifolia Sonn. (15.7%), Mangifera indica L. (13.0%), and Pithecellobium dulce (Roxb.) Benth. (5.4%). The majority of trees (approximately 70%) were <23 cm in diameter. An estimated 2.5 (0.4 SEM) million trees with a canopy cover of 8.6% (1.3 SEM) exist in the Bangkok study area. These trees store an approximate total of 309,700 (73,726 SEM) metric tons of carbon and sequester 16,271 (2965 SEM) metric tons of CO2 annually. Additional research is needed to develop functional relationships for urban trees in Thailand to overcome a current limitation for using i-Tree Eco in Thailand to estimate structural and functional value of urban forests. Study results also provide land-use planners information on the current urban forest resource and the potential for future urban greening. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.},

As people from all over the world live in Canadian cities, it was hypothesized that people with different cultural backgrounds would have different perceptions of the urban forest. This hypothesis was tested by (1) researching different landscaping traditions; (2) interviewing members of four different communities; and (3) conducting vegetation inventories. Inventory and interview data provided a consistent picture of the four communities. The British community reacted the most positively to shade trees, they also expressed the greatest willingness to plant shade trees, had the most shade trees per square meter on their properties, and were the only group that liked naturalized parks (hiking paths). The Chinese community showed less yard maintenance than the other communities, and many of the Chinese indicated that they did not want to add trees to their property. The Chinese responded more favorably than the other groups to photographs depicting landscapes free of trees. Italian and Portuguese communities emphasized fruit trees and vegetable gardens, and responded negatively toward shade trees when these were in conflict with their gardens. These cultural differences are largely consistent with the traditional use of trees in British, Mediterranean and Chinese landscaping, and appear to be maintained among North American immigrant populations.},

	abstract = {In light of catastrophic tree losses caused by Dutch elm disease, foresters recommended that the urban forest be diversified. The intent was to create a more sustainable urban forest that would not be decimated by a single pathogen or insect pest. However, recent introductions of deadly borers such as Asian longhorned beetle and emerald ash borer reveal that new introductions can have disastrous consequences for urban forests. An analysis of tree inventories from 12 cities in eastern North America reveals an overabundance of certain genera of trees such as Acer and Fraxinus. Introduced pests with broad host ranges such as the Asian longhorned beetle may be capable of killing or forcing intervention on large numbers of trees. Even cities that have diversified at a low taxonomic level (cultivar or species) may suffer greatly from the depredations of insect pests such as the emerald ash borer that specialize on plants at the generic level. Generalists capable of feeding on plants in several families will create problems for urban forests even when attempts have been made to diversify at higher taxonomic levels. Urban foresters should avoid planting susceptible taxa of trees, especially in cities that are overstocked in these taxa, and consider diversifying greatly the types of trees in cities. © 2006 International Society of Arboriculture.},

Our findings suggest that the understory vegetation is significantly poorer and more common under A. altissima than under the other tree species and that the floristic composition is significantly different. Furthermore, the number of A. altissima root suckers growing in the plots was significantly negatively correlated with floristic richness. This effect can be attributed to both interspecific competition and allelopathic properties of A. altissima.

Carbon (C) storage and sequestration were quantified using urban forest inventory data and by applying volume-derived biomass equations and other models relating net primary productivity (NPP) and mean annual biomass increments. Industrial energy use C emissions were estimated by accounting for fossil fuel use and assigning C emission factors. Total C storage by Hangzhou's urban forests was estimated at 11.74 Tg C, and C storage per hectare was 30.25 t C. Carbon sequestration by urban forests was 1,328, 166.55 t C/year, and C sequestration per ha was 1.66 t C/ha/year. Carbon emissions from industrial energy use in Hangzhou were 7 Tg C/year. Urban forests, through sequestration, annually offset 18.57% of the amount of carbon emitted by industrial enterprises, and store an amount of C equivalent to 1.75 times the amount of annual C emitted by industrial energy uses within the city. Management practices for improving Hangzhou's urban forests function of offsetting C emissions from energy consumption are explored.

This paper presents results of a content analysis and evaluation of the comprehensiveness of 39 urban forest management plans in Washington State. Comprehensiveness is the degree to which a plan includes a review of the current state of the resource, a vision for the future state, goals and objectives, an action plan for implementation, and a plan for monitoring progress. We also explored whether municipality size, community involvement, plan author, or funding source influence plan comprehensiveness. Plan comprehensiveness varies, and although most plans included the results of a tree inventory, very few conducted a full assessment of the current state of the urban forest. Tree maintenance, tree establishment, and tree protection were addressed most frequently, and many of the plans included a vision statement. The majority of plans included detailed action steps for implementing goals related to tree maintenance and tree establishment, and about a quarter of the plans included an implementation plan. Very few plans addressed monitoring and adaptive management, and no plan included a detailed strategy for monitoring the implementation of the plan. Larger municipalities tend to have more comprehensive plans, and community involvement in the plan development process appears to positively influence the overall comprehensiveness score. No relationship was found between plan author or receipt of grant funding and plan comprehensiveness. Our approach for evaluating plan comprehensiveness suggests a useful framework for future plan development, revision, and evaluation. © 2015 Elsevier GmbH.},

Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) has been used as an efficient tool for measuring tree and forest stand structure in commercial forestry applications for more than a decade, however its application in urban forestry remains nascent. In this paper, we present an approach to detect and delineate individual trees from high density discrete return LiDAR data in an urban context. To do so, the approach exploits tree inventories maintained by city managers to overcome the unique challenges presented by an urban forest, such as a broad range of tree species both native and exotic and age classes. Using tree inventory data to 'seed' automated detection and delineation processes, we are able to detect 88.3% of a set of reference trees, and achieve an average similarity ratio of 0.66 between the automatically-delineated and reference crown outlines, with a ratio of 1 indicating a perfect match. By accurately delineating tree crowns, various tree metrics can be extracted from the LiDAR point cloud, which can be used to create maps of tree condition across the city for use in management and monitoring activities. © 2015 IEEE.},

It was found that Universitas Indonesia's urban forest was divided into 3 zones: Wales Barat, Wales Timur, and Vegetasi Asli (consisted of trees from Jakarta and West Java). The zoning was based on the imaginary line which was the formed vegetation zone found by Alfred Russel Wallace and functioned as a facility for germplasm collection and conservation. Over a while, Universitas Indonesia's urban forest has experienced secondary succession, including the elimination of dead trees, species enrichment throughout replanting, and invasive (fast-growing) species dispersion. Those conditions have changed the structure of vegetation in UI's urban forest. Reassessing the zonation of UI's urban forest is important. The reassessment was carried out by data inventory of replanting from 1988 to 2018 and the use of periodic inventory data. The reassessment result showed that the zonation of UI's urban forest being a facility for germplasm collection and conservation is not changed (has not been altered). © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Urban forests are becoming increasingly important for human well-being as they provide ecosystem services that contribute to improving well-being of city dwellers and to addressing climate change. However, despite their importance, there is an information gap in most of the world's urban forests due to the high cost and complexity of conducting standard forest inventories in urban environments. New technologies based on artificial intelligence can represent a smart and efficient alternative to costly traditional inventories. In this paper, we present an approach based on deep learning algorithms for the detection, counting, and geopositioning of trees using a combination of ground-level and aerial/satellite imagery. We tested several convolutional networks, exploring different combinations of hyperparameters and adjusting the query distance between ground-level images, detection radius, and various resolutions of satellite and aerial images. Our methodology is able to detect and accurately locate 79% of the urban street tree with a positional accuracy of 60 cm to the center of the canopy. Additionally, this approach allows us to determine the availability of photographs of urban trees, indicating from which Google Street View image each tree is visible. Our research provides a scalable and replicable solution to the scarcity of urban tree data and information worldwide, demonstrating the potential of artificial intelligence to revolutionize the way in which we inventory and monitor urban forests. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Quantifying the spatiotemporal distribution of forest biomass carbon (FBC) is vital for the management of urban forests in accordance with the rapid urbanization. This paper presents a method for quantifying and estimating the urban FBC in Shanghai, China, between 2005 and 2015, using data from 93 sampling forest plots and Landsat ETM + data. Our study included an analysis of the choice of predicted factors to estimate FBC and the method of carbon density estimation employed in the estimation. The results showed that combining regression analysis and spatial analysis to map forest carbon stocks at city level make available FBC estimates for the urban forests of Shanghai, China. Based on the proposal method, there was a decreasing trend of carbon density from downtown areas to outer suburban areas. About 92 % of the overall FBC storage in Shanghai distributed in the suburban areas whereas the urban areas shared a fraction amounting to only 8 % in 2015. From 2011–2015, the total urban forest carbon storage gradually increased by 32.3 %, whereas the average carbon density gradually decreased by 8.21 % in the urban areas. The associated values both increased continuously from 2005–2011, from 2005 to 2011, but the average carbon storage density decreased in the suburban districts. The total carbon stocks in the estimated forest biomass across Shanghai were about 1.5 Tg in 2005 and 2008, and 1.7 Tg in 2011 and 2015, while the associated average FBC density remained at about 17.5 t/ha from 2005 to 2015. This study provides important information required to manage the urban forest stand for optimal carbon sequestration. © 2020 The Authors},

	abstract = {Urban trees and forests provide multiple ecosystem services (ES), including temperature regulation, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity. Interest in ES has increased amongst policymakers, scientists, and citizens given the extent and growth of urbanized areas globally. However, the methods and techniques used to properly assess biodiversity and ES provided by vegetation in urban environments, at large scales, are insufficient. Individual tree identification and characterization are some of the most critical issues used to evaluate urban biodiversity and ES, given the complex spatial distribution of vegetation in urban areas and the scarcity or complete lack of systematized urban tree inventories at large scales, e.g., at the regional or national levels. This often limits our knowledge on their contributions toward shaping biodiversity and ES in urban areas worldwide. This paper provides an analysis of the state-of-the-art studies and was carried out based on a systematic review of 48 scientific papers published during the last five years (2016–2020), related to urban tree and greenery characterization, remote sensing techniques for tree identification, processing methods, and data analysis to classify and segment trees. In particular, we focused on urban tree and forest characterization using remotely sensed data and identified frontiers in scientific knowledge that may be expanded with new developments in the near future. We found advantages and limitations associated with both data sources and processing methods, from which we drew recommendations for further development of tree inventory and characterization in urban forestry science. Finally, a critical discussion on the current state of the methods, as well as on the challenges and directions for future research, is presented. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Tree inventories are expensive to conduct and update, so every inventory carried out must be maximized. However, increasing the number of constituent parameters increases the cost of performing and updating the inventory, illustrating the need for careful parameter selection. This article reports the results of a systematic expert rating of tree inventories aiming to quantify the relative importance of each parameter. Using the Delphi method, panels comprising city officials, arborists, and academics rated a total of 148 parameters. The total mean score, the top ranking parameters, which can serve as a guide for decision-making at practical level and for standardization of tree inventories, were: Scientific name of the tree species and genera, Vitality, Coordinates, Hazard class, and Identification number. The study also examined whether the different responsibilities and usage of urban tree databases among organizations and people engaged in urban tree inventories affected their prioritization. The results revealed noticeable dissimilarities in the ranking of parameters between the panels, underlining the need for collaboration between the research community and those commissioning, administrating, and conducting inventories. Only by applying such a transdisciplinary approach to parameter selection can urban tree inventories be strengthened and made more relevant. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {The importance of urban tree diversity for improving resilience is increasingly understood by decision makers. Urban foresters want to prevent the overrepresentation of species on their streets and in their city, which could result in a significant loss of canopy cover in the event of a large-scale disturbance such as a drought or an exotic pest or disease. Although numerous software and tools exist to visualize tree inventories and plan tree maintenance work, only a few offer support for increasing tree diversity. After reviewing the existing tools available for urban forest managers, we present SylvCiT, a novel decision-support and open-source software available on a web platform designed to consolidate information related to the urban forest in one place and facilitate decision-making at different scales. While the first interfaces provide the user with a spatially explicit portrait of the urban forest (species richness, functional diversity, structural diversity, i.e., diameter classes) and associated ecosystem benefits (e.g., stored carbon, ornamental value), the software is designed to produce a list of functional groups and appropriate species to plant considering tree species already present. Based on an artificial intelligence algorithm, SylvCiT identifies the types of trees (species and functional groups) that are absent or underrepresented at different scales to make recommendations that increase species and functional diversity to improve resilience to global change. SylvCiT will continue to be developed to evaluate other ecosystem benefits and integrate criteria such as site characteristics into the recommendation algorithm. ©2024 International Society of Arboriculture.},

	abstract = {Policies to promote urban forest diversity were assessed in 49 California, U.S. municipalities through a short questionnaire, followed by evaluation of street tree inventories and approved planting lists. While the majority of respondents (82%) indicated maintaining species diversity was an objective in managing their municipal forest, fewer than half of those responding positively (48%) had codified the objective in an actual urban forest management plan. Protecting against invasive species was an objective for a minority of communities (24%). Street tree inventories, provided by 18 respondents, indicated a high existing diversity within the communities of the state of California (avg. 185 species per community; range 95-408). In communities where both inventories and approved planting lists could be compared directly, the number of approved species for future planting was 29% of the number of species in the existing inventory. This suggests that the future diversity of California's urban forests may be at risk. In order to improve diversity of their municipal forests, it is suggested communities retain an experimental approach to evaluating new species, build productive collaborations with all stakeholders as well as other communities, and develop outreach opportunities to enhance public awareness of the multiple values of a diverse urban forest. © 2010 International Society of Arboriculture.},

	abstract = {Sampling inventories are strategies to gather qualified information for managing urban forests, given the scarcity of budgetary resources for a complete inventory and lack of public engagement to reduce costs. However, procedures for testing sampling sufficiency can be unspecified in researches related to urban forest inventories and do not follow any specific pattern. Hence, to determine the sampling sufficiency, we tested different variables related to the trunk, crown, number of trees, and species, focusing on different aims of an inventory of trees on sidewalks. At a level of 10% of the total number of plots, each measuring 50.0 m × 3.0 m, we performed a stratified inventory of a city streetscape whose composition and quality represents most South American cities, with a non-patterned tree compostion. Sampling sufficiency was analyzed considering a limit of error of 10% and 15% by using 12 different variables. The stratification process was necessary for most of the variables analyzed (p > 0.01), with errors ranging from 5.87% to 15.28%. Sampling sufficiency was achieved for 10% of the total population of trees on sidewalks, at a 10% error limit for seven variables: diameter at breast height (DBH), cross-section area, crown diameter, crown area, number of species, and number of species per square meter of sidewalk and per kilometer of the street. However, this result was influenced by the variability of the variables used to estimate sampling sufficiency. As it is not possible to achieve different goals (tree registration, benefits, and diversity) with just one variable like the number of trees per kilometer of street, the sampling sufficiency estimation should be based on the use of at least the DBH, crown diameter, number of trees, and number of species. It would be a better strategy to ensure more reliable data estimations for sampling inventories of trees on sidewalks. © 2022 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {Recent years have seen a growing body of research on urban forest governance. However, there has been limited empirical research on potential factors that contribute to the success of governance arrangements, models, and actions. The present study investigates which success factors are considered the most important (and are most prioritised) by urban forestry experts in Canada. It also explores in what ways practitioners would like to see governance success factors evaluated. Starting from a list of 39 success factors identified through a comprehensive review of urban forest governance in North America, a Delphi approach was used to achieve agreement between participating experts. Thirty-two urban forestry experts involved in urban forest governance in four selected Canadian municipalities were asked to participate. Out of these, 19 participated in the study. Experts saw ‘financial resources’ as the most important success factor, followed by ‘data-driven decision making’ and ‘goals, objectives, and targets’. When asked which factors they would prioritize when (re)developing urban forestry programs, the experts agreed on the same factors. Suggestions on methods and indicators assessing success factors included, for example, tracking resources allocation and expenditures and having multiyear funding (for ‘financial resources’) and using an inventory of public and/or private lands, streets, parks, etc., and using i-Tree or other similar analytical GIS and other software (for ‘data-driven decision making’). Finally, among the biggest governance challenges they had faced participants listed four main themes: 1) funding for various stages of planning and implementation; 2) gaining support from others including other departments, the community at large, and non-governmental organizations; 3) the pressures of development in urban and greenfield areas; and 4) establishing laws and policy. Study findings can be used to inform urban forest governance in North America and other parts of the world. © 2020},

Urban forest cover analysis was conducted using aerial photographs, satellite imagery, and a field survey of 282 plots as major study methods. Based on the location, function, and management objectives, the urban forests were classified into five cover types: landscape forests, ecologic forests, road forests, park forests, and commercial forests. Total tree cover in the study area is 7.85%. Most trees and shrubs are in good to very good health and have relatively small diameter at breast height and height. The major tree species are different in urban and suburban areas, which was the result of the natural occurrence of the species and manmade disturbances. Major recommendations for the future management include increasing urban forest cover, especially in the city center, east side, and outskirts; and increasing species diversity and urban forest connectivity. © 2008 International Society of Arboriculture.},

	abstract = {Aggressive insects like the emerald ash borer [Agrilus planipennis (Fairmaire)] (EAB) increasingly threaten the health of the urban forest. Early detection of exotic wood-boring pests is critical for rapid response efforts, and allows for effective management while populations are relatively low. During street tree inventories, arborists record subjective rankings of tree condition and pest incidence; however, the extent of insect attack is rarely quantified. Moreover, it is unknown how the assessment of tree vigor provided by city foresters during these inventories relates to the likelihood of wood-borer infestation. In this study, researchers developed a borer-specific tree vigor assessment scheme to rapidly evaluate street trees, and to identify when EAB populations begin to grow exponentially based on the health of the forest. This scheme incorporates common indicators of EAB attack, including canopy thinning and epicormic sprouts, as well as attack by common native wood-boring insects. This scheme was used to track the health of ash trees from 2010 to 2013 in one urban forest with advanced symptoms of EAB decline and one without (Indianapolis and Lafayette, Indiana, U.S., respectively). Trees declined more rapidly in Indianapolis where emergence holes from native borers were positively correlated with EAB in infested areas. Over the course of the study, first detections of EAB occurred on progressively weaker trees at both sites, suggesting that early detection of incipient EAB populations can be improved by surveying apparently healthy trees. © 2015 International Society of Arboriculture.},

This study aims to compare urban and periurban tree composition along a geographic gradient, and test hypotheses about species composition and ecological homogeneity. We paired urban forest (UF) data from eight cities across the southeastern US with periurban forest (PF) data from the USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis program. We found that tree diversity, as well as both observed and estimated species richness values were greater in UF versus PF. Community size structure analysis also indicated a greater proportion of large trees and greater numbers of non-native, invasive, and unclassified tree species in the UF versus the PF, regardless of location. Both forest type and ecological province had a significant effect on community species composition, with forests closer together in space being more similar to each other than those more distant. While land use change and management has been associated with ecological homogenization in human dominated landscapes, we found that species composition was more dissimilar along latitudinal lines than compared to between forest types, refuting this hypothesis, at least in terms of tree diversity. © 2016 by the authors.},

Our research suggests that (i) residential household's amenity value per acre of forest landscape decreases asymptotically towards zero as the driving time from a residential house increases, (ii) an amenity value calculator can be developed to sum the amenity values across all detached single-family houses within a range of driving times from any selected forest landscape, and (iii) a user-friendly, web-based application, that allows users to view the estimated amenity values of forest landscapes that interest them, can be created to better inform the public about the values of forest landscapes of interest to them. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Yet, the relationship between people’s feelings about urban trees and public policy remains under-examined. Drawing on a unique dataset from an email-a-tree initiative, the objectives of this study were to identify how concern and connection for urban trees is expressed and determine how insights from the initiative might inform urban forest governance. We examined emails sent to trees using a mixed-methods approach that included qualitative coding, VADER sentiment analysis, and statistical and spatial analyses. We identified and considered three themes based on emails sent by members of the public and municipal tree inventory data. Those themes were location, age and loss, and type. In accord with other studies, overall sentiment for urban trees was positive and underscored people’s strong connections with trees, often based on routine and repeated engagements. However, people noticed and were concerned about a limited range of trees and tree types in urban settings. Based in Melbourne, Australia, our case study shows how examining feelings for trees helps residents and researchers understand urban tree relationships and gauge how those designing public engagement programs might learn from such an initiative to create meaningful opportunities for active participation in governance. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Urban forests consist of patches of recreational areas, parks, and single trees on roadsides and other forested urban areas. Large number of tree species and heterogeneous growing conditions result in diverse canopy structure. High variation can be found both at level of single tree crowns and in canopy characteristics of larger areas. As urban forests are typically managed with small-scale, even tree-level operations, there is a need for detailed forest information. In this study, the effect of varying canopy conditions was tested on nine individual tree detection (ITD) methods. All methods utilized airborne laser scanning (ALS)-derived canopy height models (CHM) and different modifications of watershed segmentation (WS). The performance of mapping methods was compared in three strata with varying mean height and canopy cover. The results showed considerable variation between the methods when tested in varying canopy conditions. Especially, presence of large broadleaved trees affected the accuracy of detecting individual trees. The best performing methods for the three strata were G0.7, F2 and Gadapt. The areas with low canopy cover turned out problematic for all ITD methods tested as co-occurrence of small trees and large deciduous trees affected the accuracy significantly. Overall. The results show that stratification can be used to enhance the quality of ITD in urban park areas. However, heterogeneous canopy structure and varying growth patterns typical for urban parks lower the accuracy of tree detection. Also, according to our results we suggest that canopy height and canopy cover alone are insufficient attributes for stratifying urban canopy conditions. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH},

The floristic inventories were divided according to five Brazilian geographic regions. Tree species were divided into native and exotic species. We identified 71 floristic inventories of urban forestry, most of which were concentrated in the South and Southeast regions. In total, 473 species and 125 botanical families were identified. The largest number of species and families was found in the Southeast region, but most species/inventories were found in the North and Central-West regions. The ratio of native to exotic tree species was approximately 1:1; however, when the five most commonly used species were analyzed, the ratio of native to exotic species was less than 0.6, regardless of the geographic region. Regarding vulnerability, most of the species included in this study were not assessed for threat (86%), whereas only 1.7% of the species were vulnerable and 1% were endangered.

	abstract = {Urban tree inventories are useful tools to assess the environmental and socio-economic services provided by urban forests. These inventories enable the evaluation of the climate change risk to urban forests, and governments rely on such inventories for urban planning and management. Here, we assessed the future climate risk of Australia and the state of urban tree inventories across 116 local government areas (LGAs), representing 21 % of the country's LGAs and encompassing 55 % of the national human population. We evaluated projected changes in temperature and precipitation by 2050 for each LGA and conducted a survey to obtain information on the extent and types of data available in existing urban tree inventories. Additionally, we compiled demographic, socio-economic, and geographical data for all LGAs to explore correlates with tree inventory status. Temperature increases in 2050 were predicted in all LGAs, with higher latitude and smaller LGAs identified to undergo greater increases in temperature compared to larger and lower latitude LGAs. Decreases in seasonal precipitation were predicted for 97 LGAs. Seventy-six (66 %) of surveyed LGAs had urban tree inventories, which most commonly included trees along streets and in parks. Sixty-one LGAs record information on tree mortality, while 31 LGAs dynamically update their inventories. The presence of an inventory and the area it covered were positively associated with human population density. More than 30 years ago, in 1988, John Gray wrote that “insufficient statistics were available in Australia to provide an accurate picture of the urban forest estate”. Our research shows there has not been a significant advance in the adoption and use of urban forest inventories over the past three decades.

This study assesses the urban street trees of Campinas based on data from a survey performed using satellite images in the year 2011. All public domain trees in the street system were counted and separated into trees, shrubs, palm trees, and seedlings. The density of trees was obtained using the images census and expressed as trees per linear kilometer for the perimeter of the block. The number of trees per linear kilometer was grouped into nine classes of different densities for data validation. The final number of trees was estimated based on the validation's results. The Gini coefficient shows that the number of trees per person is very irregular in city neighborhoods (i.e., Campinas has a fairer income distribution than street trees distribution). There is a lower density of trees in the downtown area, due to the high concentration of population, and in more peripheral neighborhoods, due to the lack of design planning. The results obtained here may be used to support a new setting of local priorities for planting actions aimed at urban forestry management. ©2015 International Society of Arboriculture.},

This study investigated the use of structural bark features from terrestrial laser scanner point cloud data for tree species identification. It presents a novel mathematical approach for describing bark characteristics, which have traditionally been used by experts for the visual identification of tree species. These features were used to train four machine learning algorithms (decision trees, random forests, XGBoost, and support vector machines). These methods achieved high classification accuracies between 83% (decision tree) and 96% (XGBoost) with a data set of 85 trees of four species collected near Krakow, Poland. The results suggest that bark features from point cloud data could significantly aid species identification, potentially reducing the amount of training data required by leveraging centuries of botanical knowledge. This computationally efficient approach might allow for real-time species classification. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Urban and peri-urban forests greatly contribute to the well-being of urban dwellers in West Africa. However, increasing urban densification and spatial expansion negatively affect the functioning of urban ecosystems. Therefore, highlighting the negative impacts of land use change on the ecological attributes of urban landscapes is fundamental for sustainable urban planning. This study aimed to assess the impacts of land use on woody species diversity, structure and carbon storage in peri-urban areas in Burkina Faso. Forest inventories were conducted in 167 plots across two peri-urban forests and their adjacent agroforestry systems. We found a total diversity of 91 woody species representing 69 genera and 26 families. Diversity indices were significantly higher (p-value < 0.0001) in the peri-urban forests than in the agroforestry systems, highlighting a negative impacts of land use on tree diversity. Besides, peri-urban forests had significantly lower tree diameter (15.749 ± 9.194 cm), but higher basal area (5.030 ± 4.407 m2. ha−1) and denser stands (317.308 ± 307.845 ind. ha−1) compared to the agroforestry systems. Tree aboveground biomass was significantly higher (p-value < 0.0001) in the peri-urban forests (18.198 ± 23.870 Mg. ha−1) than in the agroforestry systems (7.821 ± 6.544 Mg. ha−1). Multivariate analyses revealed that denser stands hold higher diversity in peri-urban areas, and that stand basal area mostly drives carbon storage than tree density and diversity. These findings highlight the potential of peri-urban forests to conserve plant biodiversity and mitigate climate change. The study advocates for a sustainable urban land use and planning. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Cities in the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region and around the world are setting long-term greening goals that include planting more trees and increasing green cover. Research in LAC cities has mainly focused on biodiversity and vegetation, with little understanding of the mechanisms underlying the decisions through which stakeholders achieve urban greening. Exploring stakeholders’ views about urban forest management and governance can provide us with an opportunity to identify needs and research gaps for urban greening and urban forestry in LAC. To our knowledge, there has never been a region-wide empirical study to capture these stakeholder views. Here we explore how stakeholders working in urban forestry in LAC, including governmental, and non-governmental professionals, define urban forests, and view management and governance issues as well as educational opportunities. We used an online survey based on a combination of open- and closed-ended questions. The survey was delivered to participants at the first two regional conferences on urban forests in LAC organized by the United Nations. We collected 91 responses from stakeholders working in 50 different cities of varying population sizes across 6 LAC bioregions. Most respondents considered parks, planted green corridors, street trees, and remnant forests in urban and peri-urban areas as components of urban forests. Stakeholder views on management and governance were divided in two distinct perspectives, one dominated by public participation issues, and another one related to operational issues. Most respondents considered operational and management tools for urban forests to exist in LAC cities, but they disagreed on the existence of inventories, long-term strategies, and ways for the public to engage in urban forestry. Responses also revealed that some educational opportunities, such as arboricultural certification, are still relatively scarce and in high demand in the region. This study provides a regional baseline and first insights into a more diverse view of urban forestry which could be enriched with more empirical studies in the future. © 2021},

How this increase in awareness has broadly translated into common practice in communities, is not well understood. This paper reports findings from a recent survey of urban forest operations as they directly pertain to tree risk assessment. The survey consisted of a 109-question long-form questionnaire that was sent to 1727 communities, followed up by a truncated version to non-responding communities. Six hundred and sixty-seven (38.6%) communities responded to the survey–513 to the full survey and 154 to the truncated version. Communities that reported having a certified arborist on staff (p-value =.010), a strategic plan (p-value =.002), an updated inventory (p-value <.001), collecting risk data (p-value =.004), and having a past claim for damage or injury (p-value <.001) were more likely to regularly conduct tree risk management activities. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group and Arboricultural Association.},

	abstract = {While efforts to standardize urban forest inventory data have occurred, the information collected from community to community remains quite variable. In this study, we conducted a global review of peer-reviewed and published research that collected tree inventory data to assess what information is being collected. In addition to this review, we also present results from national surveys conducted in the United States and Sweden that specifically asked urban forest managers about how their inventories informed their urban forest management efforts. In the literature review, tree species and stem diameter were the most collected structural parameters and planning and estimation of ecological services were the most common research objectives. The surveys conducted in Sweden and the USA found communities commonly collected records about tree species, diameter, and condition and that inventories were more common as community size increased. Street and park tree inventories were the most common inventories. Inventories of public trees on greenbelts and woodlots were less common and private tree inventories were relatively uncommon. Additionally, professional staff and consultants were more likely to collect inventory data than interns and volunteers in both countries. Despite these similarities, significant differences exist between the USA and Sweden, with several parameters (i.e., adoption a management plan, presence of an inventory, collection of inventory data digitally, collection of tree planting/removal records) being more common in the USA — possibly reflecting a longer history of urban tree management in the latter country. In modelling the survey results from Sweden and the USA, we found that having a strategic plan, a governance mechanism (tree board), financial resources (per capita budget), and the adoption of greater systematic care of trees were significant predictors the presence of an inventory. Study results also suggest that having a tree inventory reflects the advancement of an urban forestry program along a continuum of initial program adoption to more fully developed and sustained urban forestry program. © 2021},

Understanding the small-scale impacts of urban trees and strategically managing the ecosystem services they provide requires high-resolution information on urban forest structure, which is still scarce. In contrast, there is an abundance of data portraying urban areas and an associated trend towards smart cities and digital twins as analysis platforms. A GIS workflow is presented in this paper that may close this data gap by classifying the urban forest from LiDAR point clouds, detecting and reconstructing individual crowns, and enabling a tree representation within semantic 3D city models. The workflow is designed to provide robust results for point clouds with a density of at least 4 pts/m2 that are widely available. Evaluation was conducted by mapping the urban forest of Dresden (Germany) using a point cloud with 4 pts/m². An object-based data fusion approach is implemented for the classification of the urban forest. A classification accuracy of 95 % for different urban settings is achieved by combining LiDAR with multispectral imagery and a 3D building model. Individual trees are detected by local maxima filtering and crowns are segmented using marker-controlled watershed segmentation. Evaluation highlights the influences of both urban and forest structure on individual tree detection. Substantial differences in detection accuracies are evident between trees along streets (72 %) and structurally more complex tree stands in green areas (31 %), as well as dependencies on tree height and crown diameter. Furthermore, an approach for parameterized reconstruction of tree crowns is presented, which enables efficient and realistic city-wide modeling. The suitability of LiDAR to measure individual tree metrics is illustrated as well as a framework for modeling individual tree crowns via geometric primitives. © 2022 The Authors},

In a recent study of both small town tree commissions and programs in northeastern Pennsylvania U.S., there was a marked difference between tree commission members' attitudes toward urban forestry practices and the successful completion of them. Focus groups composed of tree commission members were used to gather information on why these differences existed. Our northeastern Pennsylvania study provided evidence that local tree commissions had difficulties completing urban forestry practices for a number of reasons, including a lack of volunteer time and a need for additional support and assistance. The study also showed that small town tree commissioners viewed and defined urban forest sustainability much more practically than has been expressed in the extant literature. Questions continue about how well local urban forestry practices support sustainable urban forest programs and resources.},

In this study, we analyzed the diversity of plant species from urban forests in cities in the Brazilian Amazonia, based on data from scientific articles, through a systematic literature review. Our analysis revealed that 530 taxa, of which 479 were identified at the species level and 51 at the genus level, covering 38,882 individuals were distributed in 29 cities. The three most frequent species were Ficus benjamina, Mangifera indica, and Licania tomentosa. Exotic species were more frequent than native. The three most frequent species had almost 42% of the inventoried individuals. The choice of species has been made mainly by the local population, without monitoring by the public authorities. Recommendations for sustainable management of urban forests in Amazonia include investing in training of management bodies, periodic inventories, and awareness actions about the benefits of urban green infrastructure and on the advantages of native species. Policies for the sustainable management of urban green areas are necessary. The municipal governments must continuously monitor indicators of urban ecosystem services and provide financial resources for maintaining and increasing those area rates per person. © 2020 by the authors.},

Local governments are able to easily collect detailed public tree inventories, however data on trees located on private land are much more challenging and costly to collect. This means that new regulations to limit the removal of trees on private land go untested prior to their implementation, or fail to pass regulatory review processes. Without knowledge of the location of trees or the range of their different sizes, Local Government Authorities (LGAs) are unable to predict where a new policy to prohibit the removal of trees of a certain size is likely to have the greatest effect, where enforcement should be concentrated, or to convince government, the development sector and local communities of the need for action to preserve trees. The aim of this study was to explore the potential of a supervised machine learning algorithm as a cost-efficient method to understand tree sizes and locations on private land and to discuss how this information could be used for sustainable urban greening. We conclude by discussing some of the affordances of this approach to better target native vegetation protection and protect large trees; and report on the precision and recall of the detection of the urban forest. © 2023 The Authors},

However, permanent forest inventory and monitoring plot networks are increasingly being established across forests and cities of the world to monitor structural and functional attributes of urban forests, as well as ecosystem services. We analyzed a tropical, coastal urban forest in San Juan, Puerto Rico using metrics of phylogenetic diversity (PD), plant diversity, and available permanent plot data from an urban forest inventory and monitoring system. In total, we found 152 species belonging to 119 genera and 44 families in San Juan. PD tended to be highest in forest remnant areas. We also explored correlations between socioeconomic factors and taxonomic diversity and found that plant species richness was correlated with population density and housing price. We found marginally significant relationships between housing price, population density, and several PD metrics. Our results further suggest mixed evidence of luxury and legacy effects, two factors that have been linked to the plant diversity of anthropogenic ecosystems in other research. Overall, despite centuries of human influence, the existing urban forest diversity in San Juan - although perhaps not the particular species composition - is likely to be primarily the result of climate, biome, and multi-scale socioeconomic contexts and not legacy effects. The approach used and findings from this study could be used to better understand the application of PD metrics for assessing urban biodiversity and other beneficial attributes and traits of urban forests. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH},

Existing air-borne, space-borne, and fieldbased imaging and inventory mechanisms fail to provide key information on urban tree ecology that is crucial to informing management, policy, and supporting citizen initiatives for the planting and stewardship of trees. The shortcomings of the current approaches include: spatial and temporal resolution, poor vantage point, cost constraints and biological metric limitations. Collectively, this limits their effectiveness as real-time inventory and monitoring tools. Novel methods for imaging and monitoring the status of these emerging urban forests and encouraging their ongoing stewardship by the public are required to ensure their success. This art-science collaboration proposes to re-envision citizens' relationship with urban spaces by foregrounding urban trees in relation to local architectural features and simultaneously creating new methods for urban forest monitoring. We explore creating a shift from overhead imaging or field-based tree survey data acquisition methods to continuous, ongoing monitoring by citizen scientists as part of a mobile augmented reality experience. We consider the possibilities of this experience as a medium for interacting with and visualizing urban forestry data and for creating cultural engagement with urban ecology. © 2012 SPIE-IS&T.},

However, urban trees and forests can also be vulnerable to climate change through shifts in tree habitat suitability, changes in pests and diseases, and changes in extreme weather events. We developed a three-step framework for urban forest vulnerability assessment and adaptation that scales from regional assessment to local on-the-ground action. We piloted this framework in the Chicago region in 10 locations representing an urban-exurban gradient across a range of socioeconomic capacities. The majority of trees across a seven-county region had low to moderate vulnerability, but many of the least vulnerable species were nonnative invasive species. Urban forests in the 10 pilot locations ranged in vulnerability largely due to differences in economic and organizational adaptive capacity. Adaptation actions selected in these locations tended to focus on increased biodiversity and restoration of natural disturbance regimes. However, adaptation actions in more developed sites also included incorporating new species or cultivars. Lessons learned from the pilot area can be used to inform future efforts in other urban areas. © 2016},

Finding a common assessment framework, that does not rely on a financial model, can be tricky, and many studies consider, but do not include, EDS in their tree appraisals. Compound indicators represent a means to neatly combine disparate ecosystem data into one meaningful metric. In this study quantitative field measurements, model outputs, and categorical data relating to some of the major ES and EDS of the urban forest of Meran, Italy, were successfully compressed into a single unit, overcoming epistemological boundaries surrounding different urban ecosystem valuation methods. Several methods of compound indicator construction were considered and uncertainty and sensitivity analysis carried out on the species rankings which were produced. Significant differences in ES/EDS provision were observed between trees on public and private land. Spatial analysis revealed hotspots of high ES provision and low EDS provision, and vice versa. With correct use, compound indicators can stand alongside other methods of measuring and valuing positive and negative aspects of urban ecosystems. © 2018 The Authors},

Utilizing web mapping services to assist in collecting spatially related data can provide data that previously required dedicated personnel. National or regional programs for urban forest inventories that utilize trained crews, such as the UFORE program, were previously used exclusively. Much of the information collected by crews can be collected by interested community volunteers if combined with proper education and other resources such as high resolution aerial images and ground images. Our research tested the idea of utilizing a web application built around Google Maps ™ web-based service that allows users to actually select and input information about their backyard vegetation. We extended this idea by extracting metric information such as crown diameter, tree heights and diameters by solving close-range photogrammetric models for images captured using consumer-grade digital cameras and uploaded by participating citizens. The images were processed using one of the commercial photogrammetric software. Ground survey measurements made using survey equipment were collected and analyzed to test the accuracy of the photogrammetric model. We compared the results of the photogrammetric solutions with the higher-accuracy survey-quality measurements. The preliminarily results of this research demonstrated the potential for photogrammetry to provide valuable data for urban forest inventory programs.},

	abstract = {Urban forestry has the potential to address many urban environmental and sustainability challenges. Yet in Africa, urban forest characterization and its potential to contribute to human wellbeing are often neglected or restrained. This paper describes the structure, diversity, and composition of an urban forest and its potential to store carbon as a means of climate change mitigation and adaptation in Kumasi. The vegetation inventory included a survey of 470,100-m2 plots based on a stratified random sampling technique and six streets ranging from 50 m to 1 km. A total of 3757 trees, comprising 176 species and 46 families, were enumerated. Tree abundance and species richness were left skewed and unimodally distributed based on diameter at breast height (DBH). Trees in the diameter classes > 60 cm together had the lowest species richness (17%) and abundance (9%), yet contributed more than 50% of the total carbon stored in trees within the city. Overall, about 1.2 million tonnes of carbon is captured in aboveground components of trees in Kumasi, with a mean of 228 t C ha-1. Tree density, DBH, height, basal area, aboveground carbon storage, and species richness were significantly different among green spaces (p < 0.05). The diversity was also significantly different among urban zones (p < 0.0005). The DBH distribution of trees followed a modified reverse J-shaped model. The urban forest structure and composition is quite unique. The practice of urban forestry has the potential to conserve biological diversity and combat climate change. The introduction of policies and actions to support the expansion of urban forest cover and diversity is widely encouraged. © 2018 by the authors.},

This article reviews 32 survey-based studies that characterize U.S. municipal urban forest management program dimensions, including program components; needs and barriers; knowledge of and attitudes toward urban forests; and plans and priorities for future management. Such information is critical for agencies that support local urban forest management efforts but has not previously been systematically gathered and condensed. Based on the limited national, regional, and state-level data published in peer-reviewed journals, we find that the number of municipal urban forestry programs appears to be increasing, many communities have at least one tree ordinance, and larger communities are more likely to have an official program. However, evidence suggests that few municipalities have an urban forest inventory or management plan, and most require additional financial, political, public, or educational support. More research on urban forestry program status, needed support, and local knowledge is needed as knowledge gaps remain regarding the influence of metropolitan areas and resident demographics on the presence and extent of municipal urban forestry programs. Additionally, few studies have investigated future municipal urban forestry-related intentions and priorities. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Future cities are set to face ever increasing population and climate pressures, ecosystem services offered by urban forests have been recognised as providing significant mitigation for these pressures. Therefore, the ability to accurately quantify the extent and structure of urban forests, across large and highly dynamic cities, is vital for determining the value of services provided and to assess the effectiveness of policy to promote these important assets. Current inventory methods used in urban forestry are mostly reliant on plot networks measuring a range of structural and demographic metrics; however, limited sampling (spatially and temporally) cannot fully capture the dynamics and spatial heterogeneity of the urban matrix. The rapid increase in the availability of open-access remote sensing data and processing tools offers an opportunity for monitoring and assessment of urban forest structure that is synoptic and at high spatial and temporal resolutions. Here we present a framework to estimate urban forest structure that uses open-access data and software, is robust to differences in data sources, is reproducible and is transferable between cities. The workflow is demonstrated by estimating three metrics of 3D forest structure (canopy cover, canopy height and tree density) across the Greater London area (1577 km2). Random Forest was trained with open-access airborne LiDAR or iTree Eco inventory data, with predictor variables derived from Sentinel 2, climatic and topography data sets. Output were maps of forest structure at 100 m and 20 m resolution. Results indicate that forest structure can be accurately estimated across large urban areas; Greater London has a mean canopy cover of ∼16.5% (RMSE 11-17%), mean canopy height of 8.1–15.0 m (RMSE 4.9–6.2 m) m and is home to ∼4.6 M large trees (projected crown area >10 m2). Transferability to other cities is demonstrated using the UK city of Southampton, where estimates were generated from local and Greater London training data sets indicating application beyond geographic domains is feasible. The methods presented here can augment existing inventory practices and give city planners, urban forest managers and greenspace advocates across the globe tools to generate consistent and timely information to help assess and value urban forests. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {The contribution of single landscape features for supply of cultural ecosystem services (CES) is well researched. However, only few studies do exist that identified the role of both natural and humanmade physical landscape features for CES of urban forests. Advancing knowledge on the contribution of urban forest elements and their ensemble for values people assign to forest areas can help forest managers prioritize and balance management objectives. Furthermore, enhancing understanding on urban forest visitors’ preference and spatial behavior has the potential to improve existing forest management tools, such as forest function maps that are used to address interests of the public. We examined the linkages between CES hotspots (demand) and physical landscape features (supply) to help urban forest managers identify natural resource management synergies and conflicts, and to focus management efforts on features that matter. We elicited spatial CES of urban forests (dependent variable) by collecting Public Participation GIS- data (PPGIS) from city dwellers in three case studies in Germany's Southwest (10800 markers being placed, 3354 participants). We derived biophysical characteristics, landform and land cover (explanatory variable) from OpenStreetMap, inventory maps, high resolution LiDAR satellite imagery, and forest function maps of the federal states’ forestry administration. We used Breiman and Cutler's random forest for regression to assess the contribution of urban forest characteristics for supply of CES. We found humanmade infrastructure like historic sites and sports infrastructure as well as bluespace being most important for the supply of CES, whereas natural features and biophysical characteristics (habitat) were less important. Natural features were most important for cultural heritage-, inspirational- and spiritual values. We conclude that forest managers may promote CES in urban forests best when simultaneously enhancing infrastructure besides considering aesthetic preferences in silviculture. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH},

While this figure is low relative to most other segments of the urban forest, it was received optimistically because it was higher than had been expected for an industrial area and it demonstrated a great deal of potential for expanding the urban forest through additional plantings. Diversity data indicated only 17 genera were represented, identified two genera (Acer and Prunus) that were overplanted, and provided guidance on which genera could be added to increase diversity.

Determining drivers of tree decline and mortality is challenging but essential in urban forestry planning to reduce environmental and socio-economic losses associated with tree failures. Urban tree inventories (UTI) are essential for managing and monitoring urban forests, which can help to identify successes (i.e., good tree growth/health) and failures (i.e., removals/dead trees). However, UTI are rarely implemented to assess urban tree growth and failure rates. Here, we used UTI from two Australian cities to demonstrate how these inventories can aid in (1) assessing species' relative growth rates and (2) identifying species failures and their determinant. We found UTI are useful to assess tree growth and failures. However, they require recording trees at the time of planting, long-term monitoring (e.g., recording tree size, health), and incorporating management actions (e.g., irrigation, pruning, removals) to inform species performance and improve urban planning and management. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Background and Objectives: Urban forests and green space contribute to human wellbeing. Green infrastructure is recognized by the European Union as a planning tool that contributes to the implementation of many public policies, with urban forests and green space as its main building blocks. Croatia and Slovenia are young democracies and recent members of the European Union. Hence, they also need to contribute to the implementation of those policies. Previous review studies on urban forests and green space rarely addressed scientific or professional publications in those countries. Furthermore, the body of knowledge about urban forest and green space research and practice in post-socialist countries is still rather weak. The goal of the paper is (a) to show that urban forest and green space research and practice is much stronger in these countries than it is possible to assume based only on previous review papers or only by searching Scopus andWeb of Science, and (b) to describe publications written by scientists and professionals in the past 30 years. Materials and Methods: We used a trilingual systematic literature review to identify scientific and grey literature in various databases, as well as a snowballing technique, and yielded 211 publications in Croatia and 84 in Slovenia. Results: We identified many more publications on urban forests and green space science and practice in Croatia and Slovenia than it was possible to assume based only on previous review papers and when searching solely publications in English. Croatian authors showed continuity over time in terms of number of publications, while Slovenian publications have been on the rise in the past decade. In both countries, scientific papers were most frequent, and the vast majority of studies addressed capital cities. Croatian publications mainly focused on parks and park-forests, while Slovenian publications focused on urban forests. Interestingly, Croatian authors were affiliated with over 60 organizations, and in comparison to Slovenian authors, have stronger preference towards publishing in their local language. Green space planning and design followed by resource inventory were the most frequent themes. The least addressed themes in both countries were resource management, economic aspects, policy, legislation or governance. Conclusions: Important discussion in the future, especially in Croatia, would be regulation of urban forestry as a profession. Cross-sectoral and interdisciplinary studies, as well as focusing on cities other than capitals in future, can help in addressing issues such as climate change or application of participatory approaches. © 2020 by the author.},

	abstract = {Urban forest ecosystems are complex and vulnerable social–ecological systems. The relationship between urban forests and housing is particularly variable and uncertain. We examine the influence of building renovation and rental housing on public trees at the parcel and street-section scale in a residential neighbourhood in Toronto, Canada. We use empirical data describing multiple tree inventories and government open data describing building permit applications to test for effects on urban forest structure, tree mortality, and tree planting. We found that the presence and number of building permits significantly predicted mortality at both scales, while planting was positively correlated with building permits at the street-section scale only. Multi-unit parcels had significantly lower rates of planting than single-unit parcels and multi-unit housing was positively correlated with mortality at the street-section scale. These findings suggest that where concentrated changes in housing stock are occurring, substantial losses of trees and associated ecosystem services are possible. © 2017 Newcastle University.},

	abstract = {The aim of this work was to examine how well species-specific stand attributes can be predicted using a combination of airborne laser scanning (ALS) and existing stand register data in urban forests. In this context, the ability of three data combinations: ALS data and stand register data, ALS data and digital aerial images and all of these combined, was tested in the prediction of species-specific basal areas. We divided tree species into seven and three different tree species strata and applied two prediction methods: (1) regression method, in which the predicted total basal area was divided into tree species based on tree species proportions from stand register data, and (2) the nearest neighbour (NN) method, in which tree species proportions were used as predictor variables for species-specific basal areas. Prediction models were built based on training data of 205 field plots, and the accuracy of the models was tested based on validation data of 52 forests stands. Our results showed that species-specific predictions of seven tree species were more accurate when tree species proportions from stand register data were used in the prediction. Both the regression and the NN method provided reasonable accuracy. This study showed that tree species information from existing stand register data could be used as an alternative for aerial images in ALS-based forests inventories. The use of ALS data together with stand register data and small field data could also be economically beneficial in an inventory of urban forests. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {Carbon dioxide emissions have partially been attributed to urban areas. Nevertheless, cities provide valuable ecosystem services such as carbon storage. The aim of this study is to estimate the carbon storage of Morus alba trees as a dominant species in the urban forest of Mendoza city. A stratified random sampling was selected for both urban and suburban areas. Trees were analyzed considering the following parts: stem, primary and secondary branches, and leaves. Underground dry matter was also estimated. Tree dry matter was distributed as follows: crown 53%, stem 25%, root 20%, and leaf 2%. Considering the total M. alba coverage, the urban area accumulates 24,208 tonnes and the suburban area 43,000 tonnes of carbon, from which 544.6 tonnes (1998.6 t CO2) and 1123.3 tonnes (4,118.8 t CO2) are annually removed by leaves. These quantities are relevant considering the 13,000 t/year of CO released to the atmosphere in Mendoza city. The accumulated carbon values evidence the importance of preservation and conservation tasks that are essential in the management of the urban forest located in drylands. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {All 50 U.S. states have a state urban forestry program that provides assistance to cities. Statewide surveys of city urban forestry leaders are a common tool for assessing urban forestry needs and accomplishments. Oregon has conducted two such comprehensive surveys, in 1992 and 2004. The 2004 survey was designed to gain insight into the scope and extent of the urban forest resource in Oregon to measure local program accomplishment since 1992 and to measure the impact of a statewide urban forestry assistance program. The survey had a return rate of 51%, and the results show differences among small, medium, and large communities. Results show that Oregon cities have made significant gains in urban forest management over the last 12 years. The data reveal insights of local urban foresters relative to tree-related issues and outcomes of local efforts. This research illustrates the impact a state urban forestry assistance program can have on local program accomplishment. Oregon cities that have received state assistance are more likely to have urban forestry program components such as tree ordinances and inventories, are more likely to be Tree City USA communities, and are more likely to be investing in urban forestry activities. © 2007 International Society of Arboriculture.},

	abstract = {Diversity in the urban forest is important as it reduces risks from pests and diseases and from climate change and improves resilience in the supply of ecosystem services. To manage and improve diversity, there has been wide-spread acceptance of the 10/20/30 'rule of thumb' proposed by Santamour, which states that municipal forests should comprise no more than 10% of any particular species, 20% of any one genus or 30% of any single family. While the implementation of targets based on Santamour's rule has contributed to a more diverse and resilient urban forest in many cities, there has been little empirical investigation of actual patterns of diversity occurring globally in different climates and land uses. In this study, we explored diversity and the relative abundance of the most common species, genus and family in 151 urban forest inventories from 108 different cities around the world. Observed patterns showed that relative abundance of the most common taxon was a good predictor of diversity and could be a useful measure of diversity for urban forest managers. Relative abundance of the most common taxon was much higher than the proposed benchmark at the species level, but comparable with proposed benchmarks at the genus and family level. Patterns varied by both climate and land use. Diversity was consistently lower in Continental climates and in streetscapes, and higher in Temperate climates and in urban forests that spanned multiple land uses. Further considerations in setting diversity benchmarks are discussed. © 2014 Elsevier GmbH.},

	abstract = {Through the analysis of an urban tree inventory with the aid of machine learning, this study brought together different aspects of urban forestry. Urban tree monitoring is essential to successful urban forestry. Transport land use accommodates huge tree stock which requires substantial monitoring efforts. In Hong Kong, more research is needed to take into consideration how monitoring works can be improved in response to variations in tree stand characteristics. This case study aimed to illustrate the usefulness of a large-scale tree survey in mainstreaming future tree monitoring and management in transport land use. A total of 7209 trees were found in a large-scale tree survey conducted in 53 slopes and 52 verges along San Tin Highway in Hong Kong. Dominance by Corymbia citriodora (72%) was observed, especially for the highway verges. Using chi-square tests, significant associations were found between monospecific stands, habitat type, and tree risk rating. A logistic regression model was constructed to predict the occurrence of monoculture. Every metre increase in maximum tree height, the odds of a stand being monospecific would be 1.22 times greater. Stands on verges had 5.26 times greater odds of being monospecific against the slope. The associations and relationships were attributed to the dominance of C. citriodora. By boosting the logistic model, model reliability increased as kappa rose from 0.51 to 0.63, while balanced accuracy improved from 0.72 to 0.85. The occurrence of monospecific stands could be reliably predicted using maximum tree height and habitat type of tree stands. These quantitative findings monitoring can guide urban forest monitoring. Through a better understanding of urban forest structure and composition, future monitoring can aid the mainstreaming of urban forestry in transport planning. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {The number of decisions permitting the removal of trees in cities is increasing every year, which suggests long-Term negligence, or rather insufficient funds for proper management of urban forests. Lack of appropriate tools causes difficulties in the decision-making process. This problem is especially important in a situation of increased pressure exerted by residents to remove trees, mainly due to the safety reasons. An essential element in maintaining the proper tree management in a city is to improve man-agement systems by applying comprehensive methods and tools. For this reason, many methods are used to support the inventory and identification of dangerous trees. The presented research is a response to the need for unification of management systems based on the most effective and proven methods of defining the resource, health and static condition, value, assessment of tree life expectancy or tree damage. Such a multilateral approach can improve the safety and management of urban forests.

	abstract = {Environmental inequality is a phenomenon drawing much attention in the scientific and policy-making debates about urban forests and city greening. Most studies on the subject have shown that socially vulnerable, multicultural neighborhoods are disproportionately affected by the lack of urban forest while richer neighborhoods tend to be greener. But are there differences in the resilience of urban forests between poor and rich neighborhoods? We tackled this question using a newly developed indicator of urban forest resilience, functional diversity, to determine if environmental injustice is also found in the resilience of urban forests in poor neighborhoods. Using Canadian census data at the census tract scale, Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and urban tree inventories, this study investigated if urban forest resilience is also part of the environmental inequality phenomenon in four urban areas in eastern Canada: Toronto, Gatineau-Ottawa, Montreal and Quebec City. Multivariate analysis of the dataset shows that urban forest functional diversity, used as an indicator of resilience, is inversely correlated to a set of variables associated with social vulnerability. The same relationship also exists with canopy cover; a pattern of inequality found in many cities around the world. With these findings, we show that social vulnerability and urban forest resilience are intertwined, meaning that neighborhoods already lacking urban forest are also more at risk of losing it due to a sudden environmental disturbance. When confronted with global change, considering this new insight into urban environmental inequality could be of great importance for maintaining a comfortable living environment for every city-dweller. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Urban forests are recognized for their multiple benefits to society, and increasingly so with climate change. However, they too are threatened by increased heat, pollution, and higher risks of pest outbreaks. Increasing the diversity of tree species in urban forests is crucial for enhancing their resilience by reducing the risk of mass tree losses. Yet, we lack the most important ingredient to act: knowledge. Traditionally, urban tree inventories only include trees on public land. This study describes the first urban forest research plot established in Montreal, Canada, encompassing 1567 trees on public and private (residential and institutional) lands from 84 species and 43 genera. Our paper significantly contributes to the existing body of knowledge by providing empirical data that enhances our understanding and provides a clearer picture of urban forests, particularly concerning total tree diversity, across public and private lands. We found that tree abundance and diversity differed depending on land ownership: the public urban forest included more trees and was slightly more diverse than the private urban forest. Acer emerged as the most abundant genus, and small trees dominated all ownership categories. Importantly, the species composition of trees in public and private spaces differed, increasing the overall diversity. Of particular interest was the presence of three species on private property that were not recorded in the larger public tree inventory. Developing inventory practices that include private trees can provide insight to strategically enhance tree diversity where needed and maximize the benefits that diverse urban forests provide. © 2023 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {Background and Objectives: The structural diversity of an urban forest affects ecosystem service provision, and can inform management, planning, as well as policy. Trunk diameter at breast height (DBH) is amongst the most common measures of tree structure due to its ease of measurement and strong relationships with other structural and non-structural urban forest characteristics. Materials and Methods: In this study, the DBH distributions of urban forests are summarised for 38 American cities with a combined population of over 30 million people and a range of geographic, climatic, and demographic conditions. The Anderson-Darling (AD) test was used to test the hypothesis that all DBH distributions came from a common population. Moreover, structural diversity was compared using the Shannon-Wiener index. Results: The AD test results failed to identify any statistically significant differences in DBH distributions. However, qualitatively, the DBH distributions have two primary forms, which have important functional, management, and planning implications. The vast majority of cities have an exponentially inverse-proportional distribution, such that the proportion of trees in each successively larger DBH class decreases exponentially. The Shannon-Wiener index indicates an uneven DBH distribution in the cities with an exponentially inverse-proportional diameter distribution; these cities are dominated by trees in the smallest diameter class. Potential explanations for a large proportion of trees in the smallest diameter classes include a large number of small, naturally regenerating trees; a preference for smaller trees in urban areas; or a recent increase in tree planting efforts. Conclusions: Despite no statistical differences in DBH distributions for the 38 study cities, the functional, management, and planning implications will differ considerably. © 2020 by the author.},

In the mid-1990s, a 100% census of street and park trees was completed, and together with simple health, growth and yield models, this database formed the basis of a decision information system to support the management of the urban trees - DISMUT. The accuracy of the models was evaluated in a study in 2005 where models to predict total tree height were found to be unbiased and precise, tree crown dimension were under-estimated for small trees, and tree health was over-estimated. The over-estimate of health may be due to the relatively poor rainfall conditions over the past 10 years while the biases in crown dimension predictions are more likely due to a too simple model form. However, the existence of DISMUT predictions over all streets and parks in Canberra means that statistically efficient two-phase sampling approaches can be used to correct for any bias in the mean estimates of tree numbers and size, and also to predict the mean value of other environmental, economic or social parameters of interest that are correlated to tree size. © 2006 Elsevier GmbH.

In the field, 438 urban trees located in park and forested environments were measured and mapped from our study area located in Seurasaari, Helsinki, Finland. A field reference was collected, using a tree map created manually from TLS data. The tree detection rate and location accuracy were evaluated, using automatic or semiautomatic ALS individual tree detection (ALSITDauto or ALSITDvisual) and manual or automatic measurements of TLS and MLS (TLSauto, MLSauto, MLSmanual, MLSsemi). Our results showed that the best methods for tree detection were TLSauto and MLSmanual, which detected 73.29% and 79.22% of the reference trees, respectively. The location accuracies (RMSE) varied between 0.44m and 1.57m; the methods listed from the most accurate to most inaccurate were MLSsemi, TLSauto, MLSmanual, MLSauto, ALSITDauto and ALSITDvisual. We conclude that the accuracies of TLS and ALS were applicable for operational urban tree mapping in heterogeneous park forests. MLSmanual shows high potential but manual measurements are not feasible in operational tree mapping. Challenges that should be solved in further studies include ALSITDauto oversegmentation as well as MLSauto processing methodologies and data collection for tree detection. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.},

	abstract = {Current knowledge on the growth models of urban forest plantations several years after their establishment still remains poor and fragmentary. Furthermore few studies have assessed the growth of urban plantations on reclaimed land, such as brownfield sites. This paper assesses urban forest plantations in terms of tree height growth, crown width and vertical structural using as a case study tree inventory-data collected in an urban forest plantation (Parco Nord Milano, PNM northern Italy). In this research tree inventory-data was used to achieve the following objectives: (i) to develop a series of tree height-growth models and tree crown-width models for the main taxonomic units in the study-area; (ii) to analyse the temporal pattern of current increments of tree height; (iii) to assess the vertical stratification of tree crowns using a method developed by Latham et al. (1998). The results suggest that during the earlier stage after planting, trees reach high levels of growth (tree height and crown width) regardless of the taxonomic unit. Evidence is found to support a high level of spatial competition between individual trees of different taxonomic units in as little as 15-18 years. Competition between trees appears to be mainly affected by diametrical differentiation rather than hypsometric variation: trees grow more in diameter than in height. Furthermore a decrease in longitudinal growth was observed for most tree species while the radial growth tends to be constant over time. The research at PNM shows that in temperate climates this can be achieved in less than 30 years. We believe that these analyses could provide important data supporting the planning of new urban forest plantations on reclaimed land and inter alia provide some answers to the questions around plantations growth evaluation and management. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.},

RGB high-resolution aerial images have emerged as an efficient source of data for use in the detection and mapping of individual trees in urban areas. In recent years, there has been impressive progress in the field of deep learning methods for use in object detection. Semi-supervised learning is an effective way to deal with the problem that deep learning requires a large amount of labeled data. In this paper, we proposed an improved faster region-based convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN) with Swin transformer method. Based on existing datasets, the model was trained and then transferred to new datasets. The method was evaluated within three distinct urban areas: a green space, a residential area and a suburban area. The experimental results indicate that our method achieved higher performance than other Faster R-CNN models.

This infrastructure provides many benefits that are becoming increasingly valuable as municipalities strive for urban sustainability. The value of the urban forest is an integral part of securing funding and support for urban forestry initiatives: the higher the value the more support is gained, and benefits accrued. According to available data from street tree inventories, most species that make up street trees in urban forests in the United States and Canada are broadleaf, deciduous species. Since many urban tree benefits are attributed to the tree canopies, benefits effectively drop to negligible levels during the leaf-off period. When a rain event occurs during this season, the canopy cover afforded by evergreen tree species, in concert with the canopy architecture and density of evergreen conifers will help to maintain canopy-dependent benefits. This paper investigates the role that conifers play in increasing the canopy-dependent ecosystem services of an urban forest and the unique role they play in increasing the stability of the urban forest through diversification. © 2014 Taylor & Francis and Aboricultural Association.},

	abstract = {Urban street trees provide many benefits to surrounding communities, but our ability to assess such benefits relies on the availability of high-quality urban tree data. While these data are numerous, they are not available in an easily accessible, centralized place. To fill this gap, we aggregated public and private data into a single, comprehensive inventory of urban trees in California called the California Urban Forest (CUF) Inventory. These data are offered to the public (aggregated to ZIP code) via an online data portal, which at the time of publication contained over 6.6 million urban tree records. In this study, we first describe the assembly and utility of the inventory. Then, we conduct the most comprehensive assessment of the diversity and structure of California's urban forest to date at statewide, regional, and local spatial scales. These analyses demonstrate that California's urban forests are highly diverse and among the most diverse urban forests in the world. We present a new and intuitive metric of species diversity, the top diversity or TD-50 index, which represents the cumulative number of species accounting for the top 50 % abundance of trees in an urban forest. We used species abundance data from 81 well-inventoried cities to demonstrate that the TD-50 index was a robust metric of diversity and a good predictor of comprehensive metrics like the Shannon Index. We also found that small-statured trees, such as crape myrtles (Lagerstroemia cv.) dominate California's urban forests. This aggregated inventory of one of the world's largest urban forests provides the data necessary to assess the structure, diversity, and value of California's urban forests at multiple spatial scales. The inventory's presentation to the public and the information that can be gained from its analysis can be a model for urban forest management worldwide. © 2022 The Authors},

A filtering process eliminated taxon that were relatively abundant in a compilation of 8 municipal tree inventories, then those with low adaptive capacity when scored on habitat suitability, physiology and biological interactions. In 2015, 144 trees were planted, with 2 trees of each of 12 species planted in 4 Sacramento parks and 4 replicates planted in the Davis, California reference site. This approach can serve as an international model for cities interested in climate adaptation through urban forestry. © 2017},

	abstract = {Urban forests represent a valuable resource for cities but are not without costs. These costs can include time, money, and the loss of beneficial services as results of pest infestations. Knowledge of an urban forest's tree species composition and vulnerability to pests is needed to help managers enhance services delivered, while minimizing expenses over the long-term. Recent research has explored the impacts of individual pests on urban forests, but less attention has been given to the overall pest vulnerability. In this research, tree genera currently prevalent and commonly planted in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, were analyzed using a pest vulnerability matrix to explore how the city's urban forest species composition and pest vulnerability may be changing. Current tree species composition was derived from existing inventory data, while the planting trends of a variety of local actors were determined through surveys and interviews. Results indicate there is somewhat limited diversity in current street and non-street tree populations, as well as a number of common tree species that have severe pest vulnerabilities. While new plantings replicate some current composition and pest vulnerability issues, several less common species are also being planted. As a result, overall pest vulnerability should decrease in the future, while some ongoing management concerns remain. ©2015 International Society of Arboriculture},

More than half of the world's population resides in urban areas and hence the quality of life should be one of the issues to be dealt with by urban society. Therefore, the modern concept of urban forestry places a special emphasis on social benefits of urban forests, such as recreation and health aspects, and well as on education and raising awareness of urban forests among urban population. Still, in Croatia social aspects of urban forestry have not been adequately researched. In contemporary society, technology plays a great role, and cellular phones, smartphones and car navigation are part of everyday life. All these devices use Global Positioning System (GPS) for georeferencing of objects. The goal of this paper is to give an overview of the use of GPS in studying the social aspects of urban forestry, such as recreation, health benefits, urban forest education, as well as proving timely information on urban forests to citizens. For this purpose SCOPUS, Science Direct and Google Scholar databases were used. Literature review shows great potential of using GPS, especially in combination with Global Information System (GIS), in studying the social aspects of urban forestry.},

	abstract = {Despite serving as invasion gateways for non-native forest pests, urban forests are less well understood than natural forests. For example, only a fraction of communities in the USA and Canada have completed urban forest inventories, and most have been limited to street trees; sample-based inventories that provide valid community-wide estimates of urban forest composition are much rarer. As a proof of concept, we devised a three-step approach to model urban tree distributions regionally using available street tree and whole-community inventory data. We illustrate the approach for three tree genera – ash (Fraxinus spp.), maple (Acer spp.), and oak (Quercus spp.) – that are hosts for high-profile insect pests. The objective of the first step was to estimate, for communities with only street tree inventories, the proportion of the community's total basal area (BA) in each host genus. Utilizing data from communities with paired street tree and whole-community inventories, we applied polynomial regression to estimate whole-community BA proportion per genus as a function of a community's street tree BA proportion and its geographic location. The objective of the second step was to estimate per-genus BA proportions for communities in our prediction region (eastern and central USA) with no urban forest inventory. We used stochastic gradient boosting to predict these proportions as a function of environmental and other variables. In the third step, we developed a generalized additive model for estimating the total BA of a community as a function of its canopy cover, geographic location, and area. We then combined the outputs from the second and third steps to estimate ash, maple, and oak BA for the nearly 24,000 communities in our prediction region. By merging these estimates with similar information on natural forests, we can provide more complete representations of host distributions for pest risk modeling, spread modeling, and other applications. © 2018},

In order to better understand this increased interest among the scientific community, a comprehensive inventory of scientific articles published between 1800 and 2015 on the subject was carried out. To do so, 21 keywords were used to query six different databases. Data was gathered and analyzed using the Endnote x7 reference management software. Some 3100 papers were identified and grouped by period, topic and author origin. The results show that the number of papers published has constantly risen since 1800, more so over the last decades. For example, the number of papers more than doubled between 2000 and 2009 compared to the previous decade (1990–1999). If this trend continues, the number of publications could double again between 2010 and 2019. This observation is valid for all countries, except for Scandinavian and Baltic countries where the number of related articles has decreased in recent years. The most commonly studied topics are human health and sociology, followed by air quality and pollutants. These results show, among other things, that UF research is thriving and that many scientists appear particularly preoccupied by the impacts of global warming. © 2019, Canadian Institute of Forestry.

Using open-source data on global tree inventories, this study examines (1) the diversity of species, genera, and family of urban street trees in eight cities internationally; (2) how they score on diversity benchmarks and indices; and (3) the diversity variation inside and outside of cities’ centers. We hypothesized most cities would score poorly on diversity benchmarks and spatial patterns in species composition would exist, as illustrated by established relationships between urban density and urban tree diversity. Results indicate city centers were less likely to approach the proposed diversity benchmarks than outside the city center. Overall, both Shannon and Simpson diversity indices show greater diversity outside of the city center, especially at the species-level. Understanding street tree diversity and spatial variation patterns across cities internationally can offer needed evidence to back up heuristic benchmarks.

	abstract = {Potential impacts from climate change and other disturbances expedite the need to address vulnerabilities of urban forests. Low species diversity is a contributor to high urban forest vulnerability, and this study examined 40 public and private tree inventories in the metropolitan area of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA. Applying an established vulnerability framework, this study helps to identify the current and future resilience of the urban forest in the face of climate change and other urban forest threats. A Milwaukee metropolitan area tree inventory was compiled and includes 439,974 trees. This inventory then was assessed under 2 climate change models through the end of the century (2070 to 2099). It also was assessed for species diversity under multiple diameter classes, and the Shannon Diversity Index was used to determine correlations between tree size and diversity. The resulting data analysis revealed a poorly diversified urban tree canopy in the Milwaukee metropolitan area. However, when looking at tree size and diversity, diversity increased as tree diameters decreased. Additional analysis revealed that under a low climate change scenario (RCP 4.5), only 9.5% of the overall inventory was within the moderate, moderate-high, or high vulnerability categories through the end of the century. Under a high climate change scenario (RCP 8.5), 55.52% of the inventory fell within those same vulnerability categories. Diameter class did not have a significant impact on vulnerability under either climate change scenario. This data can help inform urban forestry practitioners during species selection for planting trees in their communities.  © 2023 International Society of Arboriculture.},

	abstract = {The requirements for up-to-date tree data in city parks and forests are increasing, and an important question is how to keep the digital databases current for various applications. Traditional map-updating procedures, such as visual interpretation of digital aerial images or field measurements using tachymeters, are either inaccurate or expensive. Recently, the development of laser-scanning technology has opened new opportunities for tree mapping and attributes updating. For a detailed measurement and attributes update of urban trees, we tested the use of a multisource single-tree inventory (MS-STI) for heterogeneous urban forest conditions. MS-STI requires an existing tree map as input information in addition to airborne laser-scanning (ALS) data. In our study, the tested input tree map was produced by terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and by using a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). Tree attributes were either measured from ALS or predicted by using metrics extracted from ALS data. Stem diameter-at-breast height (DBH) was predicted and compared to the field measures, and tree height and crown area were directly measured from ALS data at the two different urban-forest areas. The results indicate that MS-STI can be used for updating urban-forest attributes. The accuracies of DBH estimations were improved compared to the existing attribute information in the city of Helsinki's urban-tree register. In addition, important attributes, such as tree height and crown dimensions, were extracted from ALS and added as attributes to the urban-tree register. © 2014 by the authors.},

Shaoguan was used as the study area where a tree inventory was used to extract data from 74 forest stands (each sized 30 m × 20 m), in which the range was increased by interpolating the stand characteristics of another 12 urban forest parks. Visitors smiled more in parks in regions with a high population or a large built-up area, where trees had strong trunks and dense canopies. People who displayed sad faces were more likely to visit parks located in regions of hilly mountains or farmlands, where soils had a greater total nitrogen concentration and organic matter.

	abstract = {Civic science in urban forestry is a means of engaging the public in the study, management, and care of urban trees, and includes varied approaches with different disciplinary foundations. For instance, citizen science has been gaining prominence in urban forestry, with municipalities and nonprofits engaging volunteers in data collection for inventories and monitoring. Residents can also get involved in other stages of urban forest research and management, including framing goals and questions, conducting analyses, interpreting data, and applying results. Diverse forms of public engagement have brought expanded stakeholders into the fold of knowledge production and stewardship of urban greenspaces, including co-management and civic ecology practices. As municipalities, states, nonprofits, and scientists undertake these various forms of civic science, there is a need for basic research about the nature of civic engagement in urban forestry, empirical evidence about best practices for different approaches, and the impacts of volunteering on the participants themselves. This special issue of Arboriculture & Urban Forestry aims to advance the scholarship of civic science in urban forestry by addressing these topics, among others, with contributed articles. In this introduction to the special issue, we briefly review terms related to civic science to connect these interrelated bodies of inquiry to urban forestry, and present the research studies and practitioner notes included in this special issue. We then conclude with a discussion of future research needs for civic science in urban forestry, including technological tools to enable data democratization, engaging marginalized and under-represented urban communities, and supporting transdisciplinary exchanges between research and practice. © 2018 International Society of Arboriculture.},

	abstract = {Urban forests are dynamic and change in response to both human and natural forces. To effectively monitor and manage urban forests, periodic inventories are needed to ensure that information about them is current and comprehensive. This task has traditionally been accomplished by manual ground-based field surveys, or more recently using GIS techniques utilizing remote sensing products, especially lidar. Low-cost Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) employing Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques have the potential to augment these sources for urban forest inventories. We present the results of an analysis of approximately 1000 urban trees and compare accuracy in the measurement of tree heights and diameters from manual measurements, lidar, and Structure from Motion (SfM) from UAV-based imaging. Results indicate that in an urban environment, the SfM method produces estimates of tree height (R2 = 0.96; RMSE =1.91 m) and diameter (R2 = 0.98; RMSE =3 cm) comparable to manual field measurement, and better than those derived from conventional aerial lidar. In addition, the gains in accuracy from SfM come largely from younger, smaller trees that are often poorly imaged with lidar. © 2019},

	abstract = {Urban forests are an essential part of adaptation and mitigation solutions for climate change. To understand the relationship between carbon storage, sequestration, and stand density in the most heavily-managed aspect of the urban forest—street trees—we modified the parameters and algorithms of a rural forest dynamics model, the perfect plasticity approximation (PPA), to reflect urban street tree conditions. The main changes in the new street tree PPA are the maintenance of a prescribed stand density via management of recruitment, the possibility of crown-roof overlap, and increased mortality rates. Using the street tree PPA, we explored overall productivity, crown allometry relative to stem diameter, and mortality rate to test each mechanism’s impact on urban street tree carbon storage and sequestration across a gradient of prescribed stand density, with the goal of finding conditions in which street tree carbon storage and sequestration are optimized. We compared the qualitative trends in storage from the street tree PPA to those found in the U.S. Forest Service’s Urban Forest Inventory Analysis data. We found that carbon storage and sequestration increase with prescribed density up to a point where carbon storage and sequestration saturate. Optimized carbon storage and sequestration result from a stand with high productivity, maximized crown allometry relative to stem diameter, and a low mortality rate. These insights can be used to inform urban street tree maintenance strategies that effectively increase carbon storage and sequestration within a given city, such as focusing afforestation campaigns on adequate areas with the lowest street tree densities. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Street tree inventories are a critical component of urban forest management. However, inventories conducted in the field by trained professionals are expensive and time-consuming. Inventories relying on citizen scientists or virtual surveys conducted remotely using street-level photographs may greatly reduce the costs of street tree inventories, but there are fundamental uncertainties regarding the level of data quality that can be expected from these emerging approaches to data collection. We asked 16 volunteers to inventory street trees in suburban Chicago using Google Street ViewTM imagery, and we assessed data quality by comparing their virtual survey data to field data from the same locations. We also compared virtual survey data quality according to self-rated expertise by measuring agreement within expert, intermediate, and novice analyst groups. Analyst agreement was very good for the number of trees on each street segment, and agreement was markedly lower for tree diameter class and tree identification at the genus and species levels, respectively. Interrater agreement varied by expertise, such that experts agreed with one another more often than novices for all four variables assessed. Compared to the field data, we observed substantial variability in analyst performance for diameter class estimation and tree identification, and some intermediate analysts performed as well as experts. Our findings suggest that virtual surveys may be useful for documenting the locations of street trees within a city more efficiently than field crews and with a high level of accuracy. However, tree diameter and species identification data were less reliable across all expertise groups, and especially novice analysts. Based on this analysis, virtual street tree inventories are best suited to collecting very basic information such as tree locations, or updating existing inventories to determine where trees have been planted or removed. We conclude with evidence-based recommendations for effective implementation of this type of approach. © 2019 by the authors.},

We propose a GEOBIA approach that considers the spectral, spatial and contextual characteristics of tree objects in the urban space. The study presents classification rules that exploit object features at multiple segmentation scales modifying the labeling and shape of image-objects. The GEOBIA methodology was implemented on QuickBird images acquired over the cities of Enschede and Delft (The Netherlands), resulting in an identification rate of 70% and 82% respectively. False negative errors concentrated on small trees and false positive errors in private gardens. The quality of crown boundaries was acceptable, with an overall delineation error < 0.24 outside of gardens and backyards. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Regional equations for urban tree crown width and height can accordingly improve predictions of urban tree structure. Using a large regional dataset with 12 locations in the southeastern US, we developed diameter-based equations for 97 urban tree species. Whereas previously published urban equations have almost exclusively been developed with one location on public or commercial land, our data included both public and private land uses. For 5 widespread, common urban tree species (Acer rubrum, Cornus florida, Pinus taeda, Quercus nigra and Lagerstroemia spp.), we also assessed the inclusion of additional variables such as crown light exposure, land cover, basal area, and location. Overall, height and crown width models were improved when including additional predictors, although competition and location effects varied by species. Study city was a significant predictor of tree height in all species except C. florida, and a significant predictor of crown width for all species except C. florida and Q. nigra. This indicates that anthropogenically-influenced variation among cities can lead to significant differences in both tree form and structure and that future model development should utilize data encompassing multiple cities. Our predictive equations for urban tree crown characteristics provide an improved method for planning, management, and estimating the provision of ecosystem services to improve quality of life in cities. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {A study of reasons why people volunteer for urban forestry projects, and of their task preferences, compared the opinions and attitudes of volunteers with those of people in botanical organizations who might be considered likely targets for recruitment. A mail survey used membership lists of two tree volunteer organizations and one botanical garden in New York City, as well as one tree volunteer organization and one arboretum in Philadelphia, Members of the three tree volunteer organizations had completed a training course on tree care or inventory, and may not be representative of volunteers typically involved in single-day projects. Collectively, 1,038 people were sampled and 63% responded. Tree volunteers were predominately white, middle aged, well educated, and financially middle class. Improving one's neighborhood was the main reason for volunteering, followed by desire for education; social interaction was only moderately important. Respondents from all organizations considered tree care to be the most important urban forestry task. Volunteers thought tree care would provide the greatest personal satisfaction compared to other tasks, while potential volunteers thought planting trees would be most satisfying. Education was regarded as a highly important task to gain public support, even more important than tree planting. Respondents were least willing, by a large margin, to engage in fundraising or lobbying politicians. Both volunteers and potential volunteers were willing to perform a wider range of tasks than they have performed already, suggesting strong potential for increased involvement. Tree volunteers expressed a strong desire to increase their level of participation in the planning and decision-making of their projects. Less than half of the volunteers thought they had been recognized for their work in some way, but recognition was mostly viewed as unimportant. Respondents from all organizations felt that their urban forest was in rather poor condition, and that volunteers are needed to improve their city's trees. Four-fifths of potential volunteers have volunteered before in some way, indicating a general willingness for voluntary action by members of botanical organizations. Many current tree volunteers were self-motivated in seeking volunteer involvement; i.e., they responded to media announcements and volunteered without being personally asked. However, personal contact with potential volunteers is an effective recruitment technique for expanding the pool of volunteers beyond this self-selected group, as well as for increasing diversity.},

Biodiversitas 23: 4033-4039. Inadequate data on vegetation growth makes it difficult for managers to determine the additional measures necessary for effective urban forest management. The management of urban forests in Jakarta also raises this issue. Collaborative research with multiple stakeholders was conducted in five Jakarta urban forests to assess the diversity and structure of the vegetation as a basis for long-term monitoring and management. Using 49 plots, we carried out a field inventory to gather information on tree number, diameter at breast height, tree height, and crown size. The i-Tree Eco programme was used to examine the data and information gathered. The widely used i-Tree Eco analysis was conducted to make viable evidence-based evaluation feasible and to help stakeholders with data processing. The results showed that the five urban forests had a moderate level of diversity, with an index value ranging from 2.1 to 3.0. The five most common tree species—Swietenia macrophylla, Terminalia sp., Delonix regia, Ceiba pentandra, and Aleurites moluccanus—dominate urban forests, whereas three of them are exotic and most native species have substantially lower values. Increasing tree diversity by enriching native species is recommended to be a top priority for urban forest management in Jakarta. Additionally, this research shows that adopting advanced and user-friendly tools to regularly monitor and analyze vegetation helps stakeholders achieve better urban forest management. © 2022, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

	abstract = {The search for means to improve urban forest inventories is challenging for small communities and cities with a limited budget. Mobile applications on iPad or iPhone seem promising equipment to make some inventory practices cheaper and faster, although procedures of use are still limited. So, we tested the LiDAR scanner application on an iPad Pro 2020 for trunk perimeter measures and the position for 10 different groups of species in the Polish Airmen Park, Kraków (Poland). For each group, in 10 trees, we measured the perimeter at breast height (PBH) and relative tree trunk position. The first procedure tested the estimation of PBH according to the distance of an iPad Pro from the trunk, the time of 3D data acquisition and the number of turns around trees. The second procedure tested PBH estimations according to the number of trees scanned in just one try (3, 6 and 10 trees). The third procedure tested the estimation of the relative position of tree trunks from other trees. In each procedure, we compared 3D point clouds generated by an App running on iPad Pro with data from a measuring tape and FARO FOCUS 3D (TLS) point clouds. The results showed that the shorter the distance from the iPad Pro to the trunk surface, the more precise the PBH estimation, not significantly different (p > 0,01) from TLS values. Distances between 1.0 and 2.0 m would be most suitable for the iPad Pro application but performing two turns around the tree trunk would improve results for PBH measurements. Trees scanned as 3-tree groups with the iPad Pro presented the smallest PBH differences compared to TLS point clouds. No significant differences (p > 0,01) were found between the methods for estimating the distance among trees, which shows that the iPad Pro can deliver a precise relative position of tree trunks. © 2022 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {Scholarship on the ecosystem services provided by urban forests has focused on regulating and supporting services, with a growing body of research examining provisioning and cultural ecosystem services from farms and gardens in metropolitan areas. Using the case of New York, New York, USA, we propose a method to assess the supply of potential provisioning ecosystem services from species and spaces other than those explicitly designated for food production. We analyze the abundance and spatial distribution of trees and shrubs with known uses for food, medicine, craft, and other purposes across urban greenspace types. To do so, we created a database of all woody species known to occur in New York City, joining a citywide assessment of trees and shrubs with additional data from a metropolitan flora and a guide to native plants in the city. A second database of useful, or forageable, species was created by compiling information from a New York City-focused online foraging application and ten field guides chosen for the likelihood that prospective foragers would find and consult them. The City's street tree inventory and associated GIS shapefile provided the basis for more detailed analyses of forageable woody species in this land use type. Our results show a substantial supply of potential provisioning ecosystem services from woody species in New York City. Coupled with growing literature on actual foraging in cities worldwide, these findings suggest implications for accountings of ecosystem services from urban forests as well as policy and management initiatives to enhance social-ecological resilience. © 2017},

	abstract = {Multi-scale forest inventory and monitoring data are increasingly being used in studies assessing forest diversity, structure, disturbance, and carbon dynamics. Also, local-level urban forest inventories are providing plot data and protocols to study tree diversity and ecosystem services in urban forests worldwide. But, differences in the sampling methods underlying these disparate protocols and data sources is a non-trivial concern in formulating comparative analyses. We assess commonly used methods for comparing tree diversity in peri-urban and urban forests when available data have different sample sizes, plot sizes, and sampling intensities. We present methods for appropriately evaluating species richness, as well as methods for comparing species distributions via community data matrices. Using permanent plot data from the southeastern United States, we present a case study comparing urban and peri-urban forests along a north–south gradient, and assessing species richness and the ecological homogenization hypothesis. Our findings indicate that comparisons of tree species richness among communities, or forest types, are often inconclusive since commonly used sample sizes do not provide precise estimates of the number of species present. While the ecological homogenization hypotheses can be tested under conditions of unequal sampling effort, we suggest robust methods such as PERMANOVA and the Raup-Crick dissimilarity index. A framework for selecting appropriate methods is also discussed. As forests are increasingly being altered by anthropogenic drivers, future studies using disparate data sources must account for differences in measurements and sampling protocols in order to produce results that are both statistically defensible and useful for science-based management. © 2018 The Authors.},

Lack of information on their spatial distribution and ecosystem service (ESS) provision is especially pressing since megacities are often characterized by irregular land use patterns, social inequities, and socioeconomic instability. We explored spatial equity in key tree structural characteristics and ESS predictors from public urban forests in Bogotá, Colombia. We used one of the most comprehensive public urban tree inventories in Latin America, ESS indicators, and geospatial data to statistically and spatially analyze structural and diversity attributes and provision of ESS across Bogota's land uses and socioeconomic strata. We found that the poorest socioeconomic stratum had the lowest tree size and crown attributes while the wealthiest stratum had the largest trees attributes. Tree diversity was greatest in northern, affluent areas and total C stocks were greatest in residential areas. Potential particulate matter removal was notably proportional to socioeconomic strata with the wealthiest having the greatest potential while the poorest stratum had the lowest. Residential land-use property value premiums were weakly related to tree diameter and height, and locality and socioeconomic strata were the most significant predictors of property value in residential land-uses. We identified marked inequalities in ESS provision by urban trees in Bogotá, Colombia highlighting a need for urban forest ESS to be taken into account in city planning efforts to address environmental justice issues and improve citizen welfare. © 2015 Elsevier GmbH.},

The paper discusses the possibilities and limitations of using remote sensing to determine the following characteristics of individual trees acquired during the inventory: position (coordinates), tree height, breast height diameter, tree crown parameters (crown span, height of tree crown basis, crown projection surface), health condition, and tree species. A total of 543 papers published in scientific databases (Scopus® and ScienceDirect®) from the year 2000 to December 2017 have been analyzed; 86 of them were used for the review. The most important outcomes are: (a) the integration of many datasets, in particular spectral data (aerial images and satellite imageries) and structural data (LIDAR), allows the most complex use of remote sensing data and helps to improve the accuracy of parameter estimations as well as the correct identification of tree species; (b) the highest precision of measurement is characteristic of TLS, while ALS data has the largest operating system; (c) remote sensing data applications are associated with a large number of sophisticated processing on very large datasets using often proprietary elaborations; (d) the use of remote sensing data makes it possible to determine the characteristics of urban vegetation at various levels of detail and at different scales. © SISEF.},

	abstract = {Background: Urban forests reduce greenhouse gas emissions by storing and sequestering considerable amounts of carbon. However, few studies have considered the local scale of urban forests to effectively evaluate their potential long-term carbon offset. The lack of precise, consistent and up-to-date forest details is challenging for long-term prognoses. Therefore, this review aims to identify uncertainties in urban forest carbon offset assessment and discuss the extent to which such uncertainties can be reduced by recent progress in high resolution remote sensing. We do this by performing an extensive literature review and a case study combining remote sensing and life cycle assessment of urban forest carbon offset in Berlin, Germany. Main text: Recent progress in high resolution remote sensing and methods is adequate for delivering more precise details on the urban tree canopy, individual tree metrics, species, and age structures compared to conventional land use/cover class approaches. These area-wide consistent details can update life cycle inventories for more precise future prognoses. Additional improvements in classification accuracy can be achieved by a higher number of features derived from remote sensing data of increasing resolution, but first studies on this subject indicated that a smart selection of features already provides sufficient data that avoids redundancies and enables more efficient data processing. Our case study from Berlin could use remotely sensed individual tree species as consistent inventory of a life cycle assessment. However, a lack of growth, mortality and planting data forced us to make assumptions, therefore creating uncertainty in the long-term prognoses. Regarding temporal changes and reliable long-term estimates, more attention is required to detect changes of gradual growth, pruning and abrupt changes in tree planting and mortality. As such, precise long-term urban ecological monitoring using high resolution remote sensing should be intensified, especially due to increasing climate change effects. This is important for calibrating and validating recent prognoses of urban forest carbon offset, which have so far scarcely addressed longer timeframes. Additionally, higher resolution remote sensing of urban forest carbon estimates can improve upscaling approaches, which should be extended to reach a more precise global estimate for the first time. Conclusions: Urban forest carbon offset can be made more relevant by making more standardized assessments available for science and professional practitioners, and the increasing availability of high resolution remote sensing data and the progress in data processing allows for precisely that. © 2017 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The Auburn University campus in Auburn, Alabama, USA, was the location for a case study to compare carbon storage, carbon sequestration, and air pollution (CO, O3, NO2, PM10, SO2) removal estimates between protected and maintained urban forests. Results were from a complete tree inventory and i-Tree Eco analysis of the 237ha maintained and 5.5ha protected areas of the campus. Trees in the maintained landscapes had an average diameter at breast height of 16.4cm and basal area of 2.24m2/ha when compared with 24.4cm and 12.04m 2/ha for the protected area. The maintained landscapes were estimated to store 6652kg of carbon per ha and sequester 291kg/year/ha of carbon. The protected area was estimated to store 41,975kg of carbon per ha and sequester 1758kg/year/ha of carbon. Trees in the maintained areas removed 2970kg/year of air pollution (12.5kg/year/ha) compared with 560kg/year for the protected area (102kg/year/ha), which was 8 times the amount on a unit area basis compared with the maintained landscapes. The results demonstrate differences between maintained and protected forests and how important protected areas are in urban environments in enhancing carbon storage and sequestration and promoting air pollution removal. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Many cities actively manage their urban trees in an effort to increase canopy coverage, manipulate species and size distributions, and maximize associated environmental and social benefits. As development is one of the most significant factors limiting tree abundance and health, many local governments have enacted policies or ordinances which attempt to reduce tree loss during construction activities through preservation or replacement requirements. Recently, the state of Florida passed a state statute which significantly limits local government oversight of trees on private residential properties – a land use type which can often account for the majority of a municipality's urban forest. In this study, we accessed ordinance databases to assess the potential impact of this law on urban forest governance in Florida's 300 largest cities (by population). We also surveyed urban tree managers in the largest 150 cities to assess the range of strategies being developed to function under this new political normal. Ordinances that regulate the removal of urban trees were the most likely to be impacted by the new state legislature and were in place in 46% of the communities assessed. Despite this, very few responding cities had changed their ordinances to comply with the new statute – though several indicated such changes were in progress. Other changes in policies and ordinances ranged from maintaining business as usual to actually investing more into urban forest management through increased inventory and management plan activities. © 2021},

	abstract = {Building energy simulation is of considerable interest and benefit for architects, engineers, and urban planners. Only recently has it become possible to develop integrated energy models for clusters of buildings in urban areas. Simulating energy consumption of the built environment on a relatively large scale (e.g., such as a neighborhood) will be necessary to obtain more reliable results, since building energy parameters are influenced by characteristics of the nearby environment. Therefore, the construction of a 3-D model of urban built areas with detail of the near-building environment should enhance simulation approaches and provide more accurate results. This paper describes the process of integrating urban forest inventory data into a 3-D energy model for a US Midwest neighborhood, including building footprint, parcel and tree data. This model was prepared for use in the Urban Modeling Interface (umi) tool to analyze the effect of tree shading on building energy performance. We used Grasshopper 3-D, the Meerkat plugin, and GIS to integrate these datasets for model generation. © 2018 Society for Modeling & Simulation International (SCS).},

	abstract = {Urban forests provide multiple ecosystem services for a range of user groups. However, teenagers are commonly underrepresented in studies about forest recreation and cultural ecosystem services. This paper examines teenagers' forest use and perception of ecosystem services compared to adult populations. We used an online panel survey to elicit motives for forest visits, frequency of visits, forest activities and constraints for visitation, and what ecosystem services participants expect from forests more generally. We then elicited perceived cultural ecosystem services of different forests by showing participants photographs of forest inventory plots for which we had detailed measures of physical forest characteristics to statistically assess the influence of forest characteristics and other parameters on perceived cultural ecosystem services. Results show that teenagers visit forests less often and also differ from adults in their preferences and activities, their motives for forest visits and reasons for not visiting forests. Teenagers exhibit more social and active forms of forest use, whereas adults use forests in more contemplative ways. Perception of cultural ecosystem services on forest photos was influenced by individual factors such as motives for forest visits, preferences, importance of forest during childhood and socio-demographic factors. Environment- and forest-related factors such as forest type, stand structure and single elements such as root plates and stumps had an influence on ecosystem service perception. We conclude that teenagers have different needs than adults concerning the provision of cultural ecosystem services from forests and therefore should be considered as a user group of its own in the management of recreational forests. © 2022 The Authors},

From this sample, there has been considerable growth in street tree literature over time and across research themes, especially following major turning points in the field of urban forestry. Regulating ecosystem functions/services of street trees, especially cooling, has had the greatest attention in the literature, but other robust areas of research also exist, including the utility of pruning waste as construction materials, the benefits and disservices to human health and safety, and indicators of environmental (in)justice.

Trees with ≥10cm girths at breast height (gbh) were inventoried. We recorded 45 species in 42 genera and 21 families. Caesalpiniaceae and Fabaceae each with 6 species dominated the study area followed by Arecaceae (3). Density and stand basal area of the present study were 500stemsha -1 and 64.16m 2, respectively. Most of the inventoried trees were native (31 species) and deciduous (28 species). Fabaceae and Caesalpiniaceae dominated the present study area in terms of stand basal area and density. The Shannon diversity index and evenness of study area were 2.79 and 0.73, respectively. The most important species and families based on species important value index (IVI) and family important value index were Albizia saman, Polyalthia longifolia and Azadirachta indica; Fabaceae, Caesalpiniaceae and Annonaceae respectively.

	abstract = {Urban forest remnants contribute to climate change mitigation by reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in urban areas. Hence, understanding the dynamics and the potential of urban forests as carbon pools is crucial to propose effective policies addressing the ecosystem services' maintenance. Remote sensing technologies such as Light detection and ranging (Lidar) are alternatives to acquire information on urban forests accurately. In this paper, we evaluate a UAV-Lidar system's potential to derive individual tree heights of Araucaria angustifolia trees in an Urban Atlantic Forest. Additionally, the influence of point density when deriving tree heights was assessed (2500, 1000, 500, 250, 100, 50, 25, 10 and 5 returns.m−2). The UAV-Lidar data was collected with the GatorEye Unmanned Flying Laboratory ‘Generation 2’. The UAV-Lidar-derived and field-based tree heights were compared by statistical analysis. Higher densities of points allowed a better description of tree profiles. Lower densities presented gaps in the Crown Height Model (CHM). The highest agreement between UAV-Lidar-derived and field-based tree heights (r = 0.73) was noticed when using 100 returns.m−2. The lowest rRMSE was observed for 50 returns.m−2 (8.35 %). There are no explicit differences in derived tree heights using 25 to 2500 returns.m−2. UAV-Lidar data presented satisfactory performance when deriving individual tree heights of Araucaria angustifolia trees. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH},

The objectives of this study are to explore the most appropriate scale for studying urban landscape patterns in Xiamen, analyze the dynamics of forested landscape heterogeneity at different scales, and identify suitable landscape metrics that are closely related to and can be used to describe vegetation carbon density. This study is based on data from 31,933 plots measured during the years 1972, 1996, and 2006 and collected as part of the Chinese National Forest Resource Planning and Inventory Program. A total of 12 landscape metrics were used to quantify spatial patterns and were subsequently related to vegetation carbon density. The results show that the most appropriate scale for landscape pattern analysis is 80km2. With urbanization advancing between 1972 and 1996, landscape heterogeneity at both class and landscape levels showed a significant increase and then remained stable from 1996 to 2006. Shannon's diversity index was the most sensitive landscape metric among all selected landscape heterogeneity metrics, and its ability to explain the variation of carbon density was better than that of forest types. This study clearly shows that information on spatial patterns of landscape heterogeneity is important for urban forest landscape planning to achieve forest carbon objective. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Urban trees provide various important ecological services, the quantification of which is vital to sustainable urban development and requires accurate estimation of tree biomass. A limited number of allometric biomass equations, however, have been developed for urban species due to the prohibitive cost. Remote sensing has provided cost-effective means for estimating urban forest biomass, although the propagation of error in the estimation process is not well understood. This study aimed to offer a baseline assessment of the feasibility of estimating urban tree biomass with remote sensing-based general equations applicable to broad taxonomic groups by conducting a large urban tree inventory on a university campus. The biomasses of 191 trees of seven species from the inventory, separated into two categories (i.e., evergreen and deciduous), were calculated exclusively with urban-based species-specific allometric equations. WorldView-2 satellite imagery data were acquired to retrieve normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values at the location, crown, and stand levels. The results indicated that biomass correlated with NDVI in varying forms and degrees. The general equations at the crown level yielded the most accurate biomass estimates, while the location-level estimates were the least accurate.

	abstract = {Trees on the campus of Auburn University (Auburn, Alabama, U.S.) were used to test the efficiency of different crew sizes in conducting a 100% tree inventory. Seventy trees were randomly sampled at-large from a previously conducted 100% inventory (7,345 trees) on the Auburn University campus. Different crews consisting of one, two, or three individuals collected and recorded data using a GPS unit that timestamped the initiation and completion of data collection for each tree. The average time spent per tree was then calculated. Crews visited separate trees each time so there would be no overlap or bias. Each tree sampled was visited by all three crew sizes at different times. The relationship of sampling time per tree with increasing tree dbh was determined using regression analysis and subsequently likelihood ratio F tests. There was no statistical difference in the interval required to inventory a tree as dbh approached 0 (intercept, fixed time) for a two- and three-person crew, but the set-up (fixed) time for a one-person crew was significantly greater (approx. 2x) irrespective of dbh. The time interval it takes to inventory each tree increased with increasing dbh; however, the rate of change was significantly less for a three-person crew compared with the other crew sizes. Based on these results, the number and relative sizes (dbh) of trees to be inventoried must be considered when determining optimal crew size. ©2015 International Society of Arboriculture.},

	abstract = {Many cities around the world have set ambitious urban tree canopy cover goals, with the expectation that urban forests will provide ecosystem services as functional green infrastructure. Numerous studies have examined intra-city spatial patterns in urban tree canopy (UTC) and found that UTC relates to socioeconomic indicators and urban form. Additionally, a few studies have shown local regulations can be linked to increased tree cover. However, the relationship between UTC and governance across different cities has not been well-explored. To address this gap, we compared the management practices enacted by 43 municipalities in Florida (United States) to investigate their potential impact on tree canopy coverage. UTC was assessed through visual interpretation of aerial images. We used multiple linear regression to predict inter-city variation in UTC based on 1) municipal forestry management practices, including whether the municipality had an arborist, tree ordinances, a municipal tree inventory, and a canopy cover goal, and 2) community sociodemographic data. UTC ranged between 17.6% and 63.3% among the municipalities assessed, with an average UTC of 33.7%. Two factors significantly predicted canopy coverage. Housing density had a negative relationship with tree canopy (P-value = 0.0116). In contrast, municipalities with heritage tree protections had 6.7% more canopy coverage (P-value = 0.0476). Future research should continue to consider the potential impacts of governance structures on the spatiotemporal dynamics of inter- and intra-city UTC patterns. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Urban trees provide important ecosystem services, across ownership and governance structures, and tree inventories are an important tool enabling urban foresters and green space managers to monitor and perform the sustainable management of urban trees. For optimal management of urban trees, a better understanding is needed concerning how urban tree inventories can provide long-term monitoring overviews across administrative borders, and how inventory protocols should be adapted to address specific practitioner issues. In this review, 98 articles on urban tree inventories were examined, the primary focus being sampling design. A governance arrangement approach was applied to identify the policy-making arrangements behind the inventories. Stratification is commonly used in the sampling design, despite being problematic for long-term representativeness. Only 10% of the stratification sampling designs identified were considered as having long-term validity. The studies frequently relied on an individual sampling design aimed at a particular issue, as opposed to using an existing longitudinal sampling network. Although private trees can constitute over 50% of the urban tree population, 41% of the studies reviewed did not include private trees at all. Urban tree inventories focused primarily on tree data on a local scale. Users or private tree owners are commonly not included in these studies, and limited attention is paid to economic, cultural or social factors. A long-term validation of sampling methods in urban areas, and a multi-lateral approach to tree inventories, are needed to maintain long-term operational value for local managers in securing ecosystem service provisions for entire urban forests. © 2020 by the authors.},

Various handheld tools and methods exist to conduct tree mensuration, ranging from the simple stick method to laser rangefinders. This study examines the accuracy and precision of the stick method, clinometer, and laser rangefinder, and introduces tree type (i.e., conifer versus broadleaf) comparisons of accuracy and precision. Methods: Measurements were taken from 127 trees comprised of 85 (66.9%) broadleaf and 42 (33.1%) coniferous trees. Trees were distributed across 4 urban land use types: park, golf course, street, and trail system. A drone-mounted measurement tape was used to determine true height. Results: Measured heights ranged from 4.67 m to 25.71 m (x = 13.19 m). Measurements from the stick method yielded statistically similar results to both the rangefinder and clinometer methods. The methods had a Cronbach s Alpha of 0.991 (N = 3). Accuracy was highest for the rangefinder and lowest for the stick method. Precision was greatest between the rangefinder and the clinometer. Root-meansquare error (RMSE) and percent error were highest for the stick method and broadleaf trees for all 3 measurement methods. Conclusions: The findings indicate greater accuracy and precision across all tools when measuring conifers. The rangefinder was similar in accuracy to the clinometer, with notable changes in accuracy when using the stick method. © 2022 International Society of Arboriculture. All rights reserved.},

While their synthesis means more possibilities for the applications such as urban forestry and urban greening, the related methods for data processing and information extraction, e.g. individual tree detection, are still in short supply. In order to help to fill this technical gap, this study focused on developing a new method applicable for the detection of individual trees in UAV oblique images. The planned algorithm is composed of three steps: (1) classification based on k-means clustering and RGB-based vegetation index derivation to acquire vegetation cover maps, (2) suggestion of new feature parameters by synthesizing texture and color parameters to identify vegetation distribution, and (3) individual tree detection based on marker-controlled watershed segmentation and shape analysis. The evaluations based on the images within residential environments indicated that the commission and omission errors are less than 32% and 26%, respectively. The results have basically validated the proposed method. © 2015 Elsevier GmbH.},

Of the 1087 inventoried specimens, a subsample of species was extracted based on two determining factors: those species that had 25 or more individuals and, in the case of species with less than 25 specimens, those that, according to the i-Tree Eco, showed the highest absorption of pollutants or the highest emission of volatile organic compounds. It was found that the urban forest removed 214.34 kg of air pollutants and generated 123.80 kg of bioemissions of volatile organic compounds.

	abstract = {Urban forest ecosystems confer multiple ecosystem services. There is therefore a need to quantify ecological characteristics in terms of community structure and composition so that benefits can be better understood in ecosystem service models. Efficient sampling and monitoring methods are crucial in this process. Full tree inventories are scarce due to time and financial constraints, thus a variety of sampling methods exist. Modern vegetation surveys increasingly use a stratified-random plot-based sampling to reduce the bias associated with convenience sampling, even though the latter can save time and increase species richness scores. The urban landscape, with a high degree of conspecific clustering and high species diversity, provides a unique biogeographical case for comparing these two methodological approaches. We use two spatially extensive convenience samples of the urban forest of Meran (Italy), and compare the community structure, tree characteristics and ecosystem service provision with 200 random circular plots. The convenience sampling resulted in a higher species diversity, incorporating more rare species. This is a result of covering more area per unit sampling time. Pseudorandom subplots were compared to the random plots revealing similar Shannon diversity and sampling comparability indices. Measured tree variables (diameter at breast height, height, tree-crown width, height to crown base) were similar between the two methods, as were ecosystem service model outputs. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that convenience sampling may be a time and money saving alternative to random sampling as long as stratification by land-use type is incorporated into the design. The higher species richness can potentially improve the accuracy of urban ecological models, which rely on species-specific functional traits. © 2018 The Authors.

	abstract = {With increased interest in urban forests on behalf of city dwellers and urban planners, there is a growing need for comprehensive information on urban tree condition. This study examines the potential of airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) for evaluating tree condition in the urban center of Surrey, Canada. An approach to detecting and outlining free-growing trees from LiDAR data augmented by a municipal tree inventory was developed and validated. Once the trees were located, LiDAR was used to estimate two field-measured indicators of tree condition: crown density and tree height. Tree heights estimated by LiDAR were, as expected, well correlated with field measurements (Pearson's r = 0.927, p < 0.001), indicating accurate height estimates of successfully detected trees. Two LiDAR metrics, the percentage of non-ground LiDAR returns and the coefficient of variation of return height, were examined as predictors of crown density. While the percentage of non-ground returns performed relatively poorly (r2 between 0.005 and 0.23 across multiple tree height classes), the coefficient of variation of return height was able to predict crown density with an r2 = 0.617 for trees over 8 m. In addition, residuals derived using expected height growth from the known planting date and their LiDAR-derived height was found to be a useful tree condition metric. We conclude that despite the complexity of urban tree condition assessment, airborne LiDAR is a promising tool for detecting trees in an urban environment and measuring indicators of their condition. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {Planning and managing urban forests for livable cities remains a challenge worldwide owing to sparse information on the spatial distribution, structure and composition of urban trees and forests. National and municipal sources of tree inventory remain limited due to a lack of detailed, consistent and frequent inventory assessments. Despite advancements in research on the automation of urban tree mapping using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) or high-resolution satellite imagery, in practice most municipalities still perform labor-intensive field surveys to collect and update tree inventories. We present a robust, affordable and rapid method for creating tree inventories in any urban region where sufficient street-level imagery is readily available. Our approach is novel in that we use a Mask Regional Convolutional Neural Network (Mask R-CNN) to detect and locate separate tree instances from street-level imagery, thereby successfully creating shape masks around unique fuzzy urban objects like trees. The novelty of this method is enhanced by using monocular depth estimation and triangulation to estimate precise tree location, relying only on photographs and images taken from the street. Experiments across four cities show that our method is transferable to different image sources (Google Street View, Mapillary) and urban ecosystems. We successfully detect >70% of all public and private trees recorded in a ground-truth campaign across Metro Vancouver. The accuracy of geolocation is also promising. We automatically locate public and private trees with a mean error in the absolute position ranging from 4 to 6 m, which is comparable to ground-truth measurements in conventional manual urban tree inventory campaigns. © 2021 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Diameter breast height (DBH) distribution established regionalized service life expectancies of commonly planted species by site type and expected maximum DBH. The goal was to develop a method to identify trees approaching senescence within an inventory. Three common urban landscape site types were used: tree pit, planting strip, and unlimited soil. Thirty-one taxa were present in large enough populations to use in species-specific analysis. The species were classified into small, medium, and large size categories based on published growth expectations. The study authors developed DBH occurrence percentiles, and DBH within the ninety-fifth were described as a maximum size range. There was a significant difference in maximum sizes between planting site types. Regardless of the size class of the tree, the data showed reduced planting space resulted in reduced maximum size. © 2013 International Society of Arboriculture.},

	abstract = {Research Highlights: A large body of research highlighted the important contributions that urban forests make to cities and their inhabitants. However, our urban forests face threats from issues such as rapid urbanization, climate change, and the spread of pests and diseases. As such, proactive and eective management is necessary to ensure their long-term sustainability. Given the multiple spatial and temporal scales on which threats can arise, eective management needs to account for these scales and adjust accordingly. The degree to which this currently happens is unclear. Background and Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the role of multi-scale management in urban forestry, using cemeteries in Malmo, Sweden as a case study. Cemeteries can provide extensive tree canopy but are not readily considered in urban forest management. We sought to determine (1) the threats to the current cemetery tree populations, (2) the extent of multi-scale cemetery tree management, (3) whether tree management plans promote multi-scale management, and (4) how cemetery tree management can be improved. Materials and Methods: Malmo cemetery tree inventories were analyzed with respect to size class and species diversity. Existing cemetery tree management plans were examined to determine the spatial and temporal scales of their recommendations. Interviews were conducted with cemetery managers to determine management priorities and actions. Results: We found that cemetery tree populations in Malmo suer from a lack of age class and species diversity. Management tends to occur on short time scales and eorts focus mainly on addressing individual trees, although some consideration is given to large-scale species diversification. The management plans previously created for these cemetery trees make recommendations for age class and species diversification but are yet to be used extensively by cemetery managers. Conclusions: The long-term stability of Malmo's cemetery tree populations is threatened by a lack of species and age diversity. Current management eorts emphasize addressing small-scale issues. Although there is a desire to improve species diversity, this can cause conflict with existing cultural values. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Accurate individual tree detection by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a critical technique for smart forest management and serves as the foundation for evaluating ecological functions. Existing object detection and segmentation methods, on the other hand, have reduced accuracy when detecting and segmenting individual trees in complicated urban forest landscapes, as well as poor mask segmentation quality. This study proposes a novel Mask-CSP-attention-coupled network (MCAN) based on the Mask R-CNN algorithm. MCAN uses the Cross Stage Partial Net (CSPNet) framework with the Sigmoid Linear Unit (SiLU) activation function in the backbone network to form a new Cross Stage Partial Residual Net (CSPResNet) and employs a convolutional block attention module (CBAM) mechanism to the feature pyramid network (FPN) for feature fusion and multiscale segmentation to further improve the feature extraction ability of the model, enhance its detail information detection ability, and improve its individual tree detection accuracy. In this study, aerial photography of the study area was conducted by UAVs, and the acquired images were used to produce a dataset for training and validation. The method was compared with the Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Mask R-CNN), Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN), and You Only Look Once v5 (YOLOv5) on the test set. In addition, four scenes—namely, a dense forest distribution, building forest intersection, street trees, and active plaza vegetation—were set up, and the improved segmentation network was used to perform individual tree segmentation on these scenes to test the large-scale segmentation ability of the model. MCAN’s average precision (AP) value for individual tree identification is 92.40%, which is 3.7%, 3.84%, and 12.53% better than that of Mask R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, and YOLOv5, respectively. In comparison to Mask R-CNN, the segmentation AP value is 97.70%, an increase of 8.9%. The segmentation network’s precision for the four scenes in multi-scene segmentation ranges from 95.55% to 92.33%, showing that the proposed network performs high-precision segmentation in many contexts. © 2023 by the authors.},

Results showed that concessions and wooded areas are richer than technical services and main roads. Seventy-seven plant species from concessions and wooded areas representing 37 families were identified and listed particularly in the Mimosaceae family. Along the various roads in the urban transport network, 1075 trees representing 16 species and 11 families have been registered mainly among Meliaceae. Technical services included 42 species and 295 trees: 21 species and 53 individuals in forest service, 17 and 99 in rural development divisional service (SDDR), 12 and 42 for urban service, 11 and 71 for municipality, 5 and 30 in the prefecture.

	abstract = {Valuing the ecosystem services of urban trees is important for gaining public and political support for urban tree conservation and maintenance. The i-Tree Eco software application can be used to estimate regulating ecosystem services provided by urban forests. However, existing municipal tree inventories may not contain data necessary for running i-Tree Eco and manual field surveys are costly and time consuming. Using a tree inventory of Oslo, Norway, as an example, we demonstrate the potential of geospatial and machine learning methods to supplement missing and incomplete i-Tree Eco attributes in existing municipal inventories for the purpose of rapid low-cost urban ecosystem accounting. We correlate manually surveyed stem diameter and crown dimensions derived from airborne laser scanning imagery to complete most structural attributes. We then use auxiliary spatial datasets to derive missing attributes of trees’ spatial context and include differentiation of air pollution levels. The integration of Oslo's tree inventory with available spatial data increases the proportion of records suitable for i-Tree Eco analysis from 19 % to 54 %. Furthermore, we illustrate how machine learning with Bayesian networks can be used to extrapolate i-Tree Eco outputs and infer the value of the entire municipal inventory. We find the expected total asset value of municipal trees in Oslo to be 38.5–43.4 million USD, depending on different modelling assumptions. We argue that there is a potential for greater use of geospatial methods in compiling information for valuation of urban tree inventories, especially when assessing location-specific tree characteristics, and for more spatially sensitive scaling methods for determining asset values of urban forests for the purpose of awareness-raising. However, given the available data in our case, we question the accuracy of values inferred by Bayesian networks in relation to the purposes of ecosystem accounting and tree compensation valuation. © 2020 The Authors},

	abstract = {Owing to the complex forest structure and large variation in crown size, individual tree detection in subtropical mixed broadleaf forests in urban scenes is a great challenge. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is a powerful tool for individual tree detection due to its ability to acquire high density point cloud that can reveal three-dimensional crown structure. Tree detection based on a local maximum (LM) filter, which is applied on a canopy height model (CHM) generated from LiDAR data, is a popular method due to its simplicity. However, it is difficult to determine the optimal LM filter window size and prior knowledge is usually needed to estimate the window size. In this paper, a novel tree detection approach based on crown morphology information is proposed. In the approach, LMs are firstly extracted using a LM filter whose window size is determined by the minimum crown size and then the crown morphology is identified based on local Gi * statistics to filter out LMs caused by surface irregularities contained in CHM. The LMs retained in the final results represent treetops. The approach was applied on two test sites characterized by different forest structures using UAV LiDAR data. The sensitivity of the approach to parameter setting was analyzed and rules for parameter setting were proposed. On the first test site characterized by irregular tree distribution and large variation in crown size, the detection rate and F-score derived by using the optimal combination of parameter values were 72.9% and 73.7%, respectively. On the second test site characterized by regular tree distribution and relatively small variation in crown size, the detection rate and F-score were 87.2% and 93.2%, respectively. In comparison with a variable-size window tree detection algorithm, both detection rates and F-score values of the proposed approach were higher. © 2021 by the authors.

From an operational standpoint, it is not known how well the software performs under varying photographic conditions for trees of diverse size, which could impact measurement reproducibility and therefore software utility. Researchers evaluated the robustness of crown dimension computations made with UrbanCrowns for open-grown sugar maples (Acer saccharum) across a range of sizes from recently transplanted to full maturity. It was found that computations of both crown volume and density were highly repeatable across varying photographic distances. For the majority of tree size classes, crown volume and density varied less than 5% on average over distances ranging from 1.5 × to 3.0× tree height; however, crown volume errors of 5%-10% were common for larger trees (>46 cm trunk diameter). UrbanCrowns calculations of crown volume showed strong agreement with calculations derived from equations for geometric solids, both in terms of precision (r 2 = 0.9783) and accuracy (B 1 = 1.0033). These findings suggest that UrbanCrowns has potential as an objective, reliable method for measuring tree crown attributes that are commonly assessed during urban forest inventories. © 2011 International Society of Arboriculture.},

The age of a tree is often unknown, especially in natural, community, and urban forests; therefore, determining growth and increment can be problematic. The aim of this study was to propose a solution for this problem by conducting annual tree-ring curve-fitting to determine a tree’s age-related dimension so that growth and increment can then be calculated smoothly. Sungkai (Peronema canescens), a luxurious commercial timber chosen as a case study, resulted in a satisfying growth curve following continuous models (Gompertz, Chapman–Richards, and von Bertalanffy) and discrete models (Bahtiar and Darwis exponential modification). The Chapman–Richards model gave the best-fit sigmoid growth curve. The first derivation (dN/dt) of the growth formula produces the current annual increment (CAI). CAI intersection with mean annual increment (MAI) at the peak of MAI resulted in the optimum biological rotation age and a cutting cycle period of 30 years for the Sungkai plantation commonly planted in urban forests. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Tree roots often come in conflict with elements of the built environment, particularly when planted in limited soil locations. For street trees located between roadways and sidewalks, minimum planting width requirements can be calculated to prevent large supporting roots from lifting or growing over paved surfaces. In this study, we used diameter at breast height (DBH) to predict trunk flare diameter for common shade tree species from four different communities in the United States (Milwaukee, Minneapolis, Saint Paul, and Tampa). These predictive models were then used to calculate minimum width requirements to reduce infrastructure damage given the maximum expected DBH measurements for each species based on existing urban forest inventory data in the communities studied. For all ten taxa tested, DBH was a significant predictor of trunk flare diameter (minimum R2 = 0.81), indicating that this commonly used urban forestry measurement can be used to design minimum growing space based on selected species to potentially prevent root and infrastructure conflicts. The methods employed in this paper can be easily replicated by other researchers in order to create guidelines for species and environments not captured in our data set. Alternatively, broader functions for estimating trunk flare based on DBH are provided for species based on natural habitat type (i.e., upland, wetland, variable). © 2020 Elsevier GmbH},

Traditionally, professional inventory crews have been used to collect the inventory data needed for these models, but several cities have established crowdsourcing platforms to allow volunteers to map and inventory trees. Students in this study hosted and participated in an Arbor Day inventory collection event, using a newly released crowdsourcing application for mapping trees and estimating ecosystem services. The students located, identified, and measured trees on the University of South Florida campus (Tampa, Florida, U.S.) after a brief training session. After the one-day event, a more rigorously-trained field crew attempted to relocate the inventoried trees to assess the accuracy and variability of the data collected. Of the 339 trees inventoried at the original event, only 57.8% (n = 196) had coordinates that were accurate enough to re-measure. Of the 196 re-measured trees, 91.3% (n = 179) were correctly identified. However, only 47.9% (n = 91) of trees had dbh measurements within a one inch (2.5 cm) threshold for accuracy.

Researchers surveyed home-rule municipalities (pop. 5,000 or greater) in Texas, U.S. to assess the commonality of the components of a municipal forestry program, municipal spending on urban forestry, and amount of assistance received from the Texas A&M Forest Service. Spending on urban forestry in Texas cities averaged USD $4.88 per capita overall. Basic tree ordinances, tree boards, non-profit tree advocacy groups, and proactive maintenance cycles were all fairly common. Urban forest management plans and tree inventories were very uncommon. About 70% of municipal forestry programs are housed in their cities' Parks and Recreation Department, with the majority of the remainder occurring in their Public Works Department. The level of assistance received by municipalities from the Texas A&M Forest Service is consistent with the budget priorities and mission statement of that organization, which focuses on delivering technical and educational assistance over financial assistance. A lack of recent national trends to compare against greatly hampers understanding the efforts of Texas municipalities relative to other states. However, identifying current trends in Texas offers value to the Texas A&M Forest Service to understand the effect of their service delivery strategy. Urban foresters and city managers can also use these results to compare themselves against their peers, a common practice in setting municipal budgets and policy. ©2016 International Society of Arboriculture.},

Urban forest inventory data analyzed by programs such as the i-Tree ECO inventory method is a good candidate for such an approach. In this research, we tested the feasibility of using spatially referenced data gathered and submitted by non-professional individuals through a web application to augment urban forest inventory data. We examined the use of close range photogrammetry solutions of images taken by consumer-grade cameras to extract quantitative metric information such as crown diameter, tree heights and trunk diameters. Several tests were performed to evaluate the accuracy of the photogrammetric solutions and to examine their use in addition to existing aerial image data to supplement or partially substitute for standard i-Tree ECO field measurements. Digital images of three sample sites were acquired using different consumer-grade cameras. Several photogrammetric solutions were performed using the acquired image sets. Each model was carried out using a relative orientation process followed by baseline model scaling. Several distances obtained through this solution were compared to the corresponding distances obtained through direct measurements in order to assess the quality of the model scaling approach. Measured i-Tree ECO field plot inventory data, online aerial image measurements and photogrammetric observations were compared. The results demonstrate the potential for using aerial image digitizing in addition to ground images to assist in participatory urban forest inventory efforts. © 2010.},

	abstract = {Segmenting individual street trees from a street side-view point cloud is the first and key step of obtaining a street tree inventory. Using the classification-segmentation framework for individual tree segmentation makes tree detection simple and accurate, but segmenting overlapping trees is still challenging. To more accurately segment overlapping trees, a coarse-to-fine method for segmenting individual street trees from a side-view point cloud is proposed in this paper. Following the classification-segmentation framework, the tree points are first detected from the side-view street point cloud by a pointwise classifier fused from 13 local geometric features and then trained using random forest (RF). Second, the tree proposals are obtained by density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) clustering and detection error filtering. Third, the overlapping tree proposals are recognized by trunk identification, and the single tree proposals are directly output as individual trees. Fourth, the overlapping trees are roughly divided into individual tree proposals through vertical planes. Finally, individual trees with optimized contours are obtained by iteratively using DBSCAN clustering and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classification. The side-view point cloud of a 290 m-long urban street containing 77 street trees is captured by a hand-held mobile ZEB Horizon laser scanner. The tree detection attained an F1 score of 0.9916 with a precision of 0.9989 and a recall of 0.9864. For individual tree segmentation, the F1 score was 0.9745 with a precision of 0.9672 and a recall of 0.9819. Compared to two current classification-segmentation methods, the overlapping tree segmentation F1 scores were increased by 0.0914 and 0.0617, respectively. The proposed method can be applied to tree parameter extraction, which is an important urban forest inventory task and is crucial for urban forest management. In our experiment, the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the trunk diameter at breast height (DBH) estimation was 0.8485 cm. © 2023 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {There is a perception that increased forest cover and density in urban contexts is associated with increased criminality. But, this complex relationship between urban vegetation, crime, ecosystem services (ES) and disservices (ED), has been little studied in low and middle income countries. This study's aim was to statistically determine if specific structural and socioeconomic characteristics of urban treescapes were related to crime occurrence, considered an ED, in a major Latin American city. We used spatial and statistical analyses of a public tree inventory, homicide occurrence, and available geospatial data to analyze if urban treescape, demographic, and socioeconomic variables were related to the incidence of homicides in Neotropical Bogota, Colombia. First, a generalized linear model indicated that fewer homicides occurred in public treescapes with taller trees and higher tree density. In contrast, the amount of overall green space and average tree basal area were not significant predictors of homicide occurrence. Second, a geographically weighted regression model indicated that the inclusion of tree basal area rendered tree height insignificant, and that higher basal areas were associated with fewer homicides. Thus, both models indicated that increased tree density and size were actually associated with lower homicide occurrences. The amount of public green areas was however, not significantly related to homicide occurrence. Results indicate that in general, Bogota´s treescapes provided overall net ES as opposed to ED in terms of crime. Findings could be used to develop land use policies and management practices that increase the overall provision and demand for ES from urban forests. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In the context of carbon neutrality and urbanization, there is a notable research gap regarding the carbon sequestration benefits of urban forests and the identification of suitable tree species for achieving sustainable carbon sequestration. In this study, we examined the dynamics and drivers of urban forest carbon sequestration in Shanghai, one of the most urbanized cities in China. First, we compiled a comprehensive field inventory data set spanning 20 years for the Shanghai Green Belt. Second, we quantified and compared the total carbon accumulation and growth rates of six monoculture forests and two mixed forest types consisting of six common tree species. Third, we conducted drivers analysis of the effects of stand-related and anthropogenic factors on carbon accumulation and growth rates. Overall, our results revealed that each forest type exhibited a unique growth pattern of tree biomass carbon (TBC), with the Chapman–Richards growth function providing an accurate representation of carbon dynamics. During the early stages of development (within 20 years), the carbon accumulation rate of Populus L. reached 4.13 Mg ha−1 yr−1, which was approximately 127 % higher than that of broadleaf mixed forests. In late stages, the potential tree biomass carbon accumulation of broadleaf mixed forests reached 172.8 Mg ha−1, which was 34 % higher than that of Populus L. over the entire growth cycle. Forest types, stand age, canopy density class, ownership, closure management, strongly influence the accumulation rates of TBC. Overall, these findings contribute to the understanding of the advantages of mixed and monoculture plantations for carbon sequestration, and these results can be used to predict future patterns of carbon storage in urban forests in Shanghai. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The collection and analysis of urban forest inventory data has been steadily increasing in recent decades. In addition to typical assessments such as number of trees, size distribution, and species composition, estimates of ecosystem services provide empirical indicators of quantity and monetary value to anthropologic populations. As most urban inventories are sample-based, sources of uncertainty and their magnitude provide important information for judging the reliability of estimated population parameters. Most modern analysis tools provide an indication of uncertainty via a sampling error statistic, but other types of uncertainty due to measurements or statistical models are not accounted for. In this study, we examined measurement variation for a suite of urban tree attributes and found measurements were equally or less variable than those taken on forest-grown trees. The notable exception was tree diameter which was more highly variable. In addition to quantifying the measurement variability, simulations that propagate the variation were conducted to assess the additional variance incurred for estimates of ecosystem services and associated valuations. The results generally indicated an increase of about 1% or less in the standard error of the estimate for most ecosystem services and their value. Measurement variation may contribute larger amounts of uncertainty for urban inventories lacking adequate field crew training and quality assurance processes. © 2021},

This study represents the first research to propose the concept of crown resolution to comprehensively evaluate the co-effect of image resolution and crown size on deep learning. Six images with different resolutions were derived from a DJI Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), and 1344 manually delineated Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb) Hook) tree crowns were used for six training and validation mask region-based convolutional neural network (Mask R-CNN) models, while additional 476 delineated tree crowns were reserved for testing. The overall detection accuracy, the influence of different crown sizes, and crown resolutions were calculated to evaluate model performance accuracy with different image resolutions for ITDD. Results show that the highest accuracy was achieved when the crown resolution was between 800 and 12800 pixels/tree. The accuracy of ITDD was impacted by crown resolution, and it was unable to effectively identify Chinese fir when the crown resolution was less than 25 pixels/tree or higher than 12800 pixels/tree. The study highlights crown resolution as a critical factor affecting ITDD and suggests selecting the appropriate resolution based on the target detected crown size. © 2023 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Urban forests generally have a heterogeneous structure consisting of small vegetation patches. High spatial resolution digital aerial images are still a primary data source for urban forest inventories. In the present study, the estimation possibilities of the structural diversity of urban forests were evaluated using image properties extracted from digital aerial images. Firstly, relationships between structural diversity indices and image properties were determined using the correlation analysis. It was found out that structural diversity indices were significantly correlated with spectral and textural properties. The strongest relationship was calculated between the normalized difference vegetation index and species-based Shannon–Wiener diversity index(Hs′) (r = 0.599, p < 0.01). The relationship between textural properties and structural diversity indices was slightly lower compared to spectral properties. The strongest relationship between textural properties and structural diversity indices was calculated between the Entropy values derived from DVI and Hs′ (r = 0.478, p < 0.01). Afterward, each used diversity index was modeled as a function of the textural and spectral properties of digital aerial images. Univariate and multivariate linear regression models were used for this purpose. While the adjusted coefficient of determination (Radj2) of univariate regression models varies between 0.07 and 0.37, the Radj2 values of a multivariate model vary between 0.13 and 0.57. Among the developed models, only the estimation models of tree size diversity (Hh′) and tree species diversity (Hs′) provided an estimation accuracy that could be used in practice. © 2019, Indian Society of Remote Sensing.},

The examinations were carried out based on the related typical feature variables, i.e., 1) overstory tree stem positioning accuracy as a substitute and 2) understory tree height and crown width and the newly proposed measure of object detail characterization, i.e., 3) primary nearest point distance (PNPD).

Focusing on woody plants with a diameter at breast height > 5 cm, 2,027 stems (78 species) were measured in Niamey and 2,456 stems (90 species) were measured in Maradi. The mean carbon stock was 31.63 (15.63, 47.64) in Niamey and 58.30 (13.10, 103.50) t/ha in Maradi. The mean carbon stock was significantly different in each city (p < 0.05) across land use types. The results show that the conversion of peri-urban forests into the urban forest in any of the land use types is associated with carbon gain.

	abstract = {The benefits and services of urban forests are becoming increasingly well documented, with carbon storage being the main focus of attention. Recent efforts in urban remote sensing have incorporated additional data such as LiDAR data but have been limited to sections of an urban area or only certain species. Existing models are not generalizable to remaining unmeasured urban trees. To make a generalizable individual urban tree model, we used metrics from NAIP aerial imagery and NOAA and USGS LiDAR data for 2013 and 2019, and two crown-level urban tree biomass models were developed. We ran a LASSO regression, which selected the best variables for the biomass model, followed by a 10-fold cross-validation. The 2013 model had an adjusted R2 value of 0.85 and an RMSE of 1797 kg, whereas the 2019 model had an adjusted R2 value of 0.87 and an RMSE of 1444 kg. The 2019 model was then applied to the rest of the unsampled trees to estimate the total biomass and total carbon stored for all the trees in the county. Recommendations include changes to ground inventory techniques to adapt to the current methods and limitations of remote sensing biomass estimation. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The Rhine River valley of Germany has been facing recurrent and intense spells of drought and heatwaves threatening the health of trees in peri-urban forests. Crown damage intensified by climate change accelerates tree mortality, threatening its ecological, economic, and social benefits; however, the pattern of crown die-back in peri-urban forests remained unclear. We performed a field inventory to estimate the crown die-back of 2578 trees of 51 species from 68 randomly selected peri-urban forest plots in Karlsruhe region on the right bank of the Rhine, after the catastrophic summer heatwave and drought of 2018. We related crown die-back to species-specific drought tolerance, wood anatomical traits, tree size, canopy surface temperature, tree density, Shannon's diversity and Gini coefficient for tree height. Regression results indicate that small-size trees were found to be more susceptible to canopy damage than large trees, with a 1-meter increase in tree height associated with a 0.8 % reduction in crown die-back. This size-dependent process is also species-specific. Among the 12 species with significant (p < 0.05) linear relationship between height and die-back, 9 species demonstrated negative correlations and 3 species showed positive relationships. Species tolerant to drought or cavitation (e.g., trees with diffuse porous xylem, 21 species) had significantly lower crown dieback. For example, with a 1-point-scale increase in drought tolerance crown die-back declined 14.35 %. Trees that experienced high canopy surface temperature and grew with high tree density and species diversity (Shannon's diversity) had more crown die-back. However, high structural diversity (Gini coefficient) was related to lower crown die-back. Our results suggested that future research should focus more on tree species-specific hydraulic and thermal traits and tree density and structure management to improve tree health and species selection in peri-urban forests under future climate change. © 2023},

	abstract = {Urban expansion and associated habitat transformation drives shifts in biodiversity, with declines in taxonomic and functional diversity. Forests fragments within urban landscapes offer a number of ecosystem services, and help to maintain biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Here, we focus on a tropical forest environment, and on the soil biota. Using eDNA metabarcoding, we compare forest fragments within the city of Cayenne, French Guiana, with a neighbouring continuous undisturbed forest. We wished to determine if urban forest fragments conserve high levels of alpha and beta diversity as well as similar functional composition for plants, soil animals, fungi and bacteria. We found that alpha diversity is similar across habitats for plants and fungi, lower in urban forests for metazoans and higher for bacteria. We also found that urban forests communities differ from undisturbed forests in their taxonomic composition, with urban forests exhibiting greater turnover between fragments potentially caused by ecological drift and limited dispersal. However, their functional composition exhibited limited differences, with an enrichment of palms, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and bacteria and a depletion of climber plants and termites. Thus, although urban forest fragments do shelter soil biodiversity that differs from native forests, the losses of soil functions may be relatively limited. This study demonstrates the strong potential of a multi-taxa eDNA approach for rapid inventories across taxonomic kingdoms, in particular for cryptic soil diversity. It also demonstrates the key role of urban forest fragments in conserving biodiversity and ecosystem function, and points to a need for more systematic monitoring of these areas in urban management plans. © 2021 The Authors},

For the species-rich urban setting of Washington, D.C. USA, we evaluate current prospects toward this goal by combining a Random Forest (RF) object-based tree species classification method with two large datasets 1) A suite of 12 very high resolution (VHR) WorldView-3 images (WV-3), whose image acquisition date cover each pheno-phase of the growing season from April to November; and 2) the 16,496 street trees from Washington D.C. Department of Transportation's (DDOT) field inventory. We classify the 19 most abundant tree species with an overall accuracy of 61.3% and classify the ten most abundant genera with an overall accuracy of 73.7%. We observe that (1) there are larger declines in accuracy when attempting to classify species in the same genus, and (2) the most valuable phenological period is fall senescence for classification at different taxonomic levels. Especially if satellite data can be matched to the key pheno-phases, our study highlights that current VHR satellite sensors now have the radiometric, spectral, and spatial resolution to potentially help manage species-rich urban forests. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

Trained volunteers in each community were used to identify, measure, and assess their community trees. Training methods, technical assistance, and measurement tools utilized were updated between 2009 and 2011 based on input from community volunteers and university training staff, allowing for a post hoc study of volunteer efficacy to be conducted. To assess volunteer efficacy and the effect of updated training protocols on data quality, comparisons between volunteer-collected data and university-collected data were analyzed for agreement in genus and species identification, tree measurements, and condition rating for a subsample of trees in each community. Agreement was the greatest for tree identification at the genus level (>90%) and the lowest overall for condition rating (<70%) for all communities. Statistically differences between the 2009 and 2011 communities were detected with 2011 communities having higher levels of agreement on average. The increased probability of agreement with university researchers is likely attributable to increased focus on field-instruction, technical assistance, and more sophisticated tools used by the 2011 communities. However, detailed volunteer demographic data for each community was not available for analysis and could provide further insight into differences detected. Decisions to use volunteer collected data should incorporate appropriate levels of training and tool sophistication for the level of specificity required for a project. © 2018 International Society of Arboriculture.},

	abstract = {The first state-legislated and mandated municipal urban forestry officials in the United States were tree wardens. Massachusetts state law enabled municipalities to appoint tree wardens first in 1896 and mandated their appointment beginning in 1899; five other states passed similar legislation shortly thereafter. These municipal officials have jurisdiction over most, and sometimes all, public trees in the municipality they serve. This study used a structured mail survey to explore ways tree wardens acquire professional information, what modes of learning they prefer, how they interact with their communities, and what urban forestry tasks they do. Results suggest that New England tree wardens acquire information in several ways, including the Internet, yet prefer traditional outreach education tools such as workshops and conferences, especially those that involve more than one speaker, informational handouts, and both indoor and outdoor lectures and exercises. Tree wardens value highly interacting with other tree wardens and depend on peers and colleagues for information and assistance in decision making. They also value other organizations, such as the Cooperative Extension System, state forestry agencies, and state tree warden associations, for information. Results further suggest that public safety is their primary motivation and that they spend most of their time on associated tasks such as risk tree assessment and removal. They recognize the value of tree replacement and certain urban forestry planning practices such as tree risk assessment and inventories. Tree wardens place less importance on municipal shade tree ordinances and shade tree or urban forest committees or commissions. It is recommended that people and organizations responsible for tree warden education conduct activities that bring tree wardens together frequently and combine social and educational activities and emphasize traditional outreach education delivery systems. © 2006 Elsevier GmbH.

	abstract = {The urban forest is a valuable ecosystem service provider, yet cities are frequently degraded environments with a myriad of stressors and disturbances affecting trees. Vulnerability science is increasingly used to explore issues of sustainability in complex social-ecological systems, and can be a useful approach for assessing urban forests. The purpose of this study was to identify and explore drivers of urban forest vulnerability in a residential neighborhood. Based on a recently published framework of urban forest vulnerability, a series of indicators of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity that describe the built environment, urban forest structure, and human population, respectively, were assessed for 806 trees in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Tree mortality, condition, and diameter growth rates were then assessed using an existing 2007/2008 inventory. A bivariate analysis was first conducted to test for significant relationships of vulnerability indicators with mortality, condition, and growth. A multivariate analysis was then conducted using multiple linear regression for the continuous condition and growth variables and a multilayer perceptron neural network for the binary mortality variable. Commercial land uses and commercial buildings adjacent to trees consistently explained higher mortality rates and poor tree conditions. However, at finer spatial scales it is important to differentiate between different causes and correlates of urban forest decline within commercial land uses. Tree species, size, and condition were also important indicators of vulnerability. Understanding the causes of urban forest change and decline are essential for developing planning strategies to reduce long-term system vulnerability. © 2019 International Society of Arboriculture.

	abstract = {In conjunction with urbanization and its importance as a major driver of land-use change, increased efforts have been placed on understanding urban forests and the provisioning of ecosystem services. However, very little research has been conducted on private property and little is known about the structure and function of privately owned urban forests. This research examines the structure of and carbon storage services provided by private residential urban forests in a moderate-sized Midwestern city. The primary research questions are as follows: What is the structure of private urban forests, and how does it vary across parcels? How much carbon is stored in tree and soil pools of private urban forests, and how does carbon vary across parcels? Ecological inventories were conducted on 100 residential parcels within 14 Neighborhood and Homeowners Associations of varying size and development age. Tree species richness, diversity, density, and diameter distribution were determined on a per parcel basis and for the entire tree population sampled. Further, tree and soil carbon storage were determined for each parcel. Results of this research demonstrated large variability in per-parcel tree metrics. Twelve of the parcels sampled had two or fewer trees, while eleven had greater than 50 trees. Further, tree carbon storage ranged from no carbon to 11.22kgCm-2. Alternatively, soil carbon storage was less variable and averaged 4.7kgCm-2, approximately 1.9 times higher than the average carbon stored in trees (2.5kgCm-2). Management efforts aimed at maintaining or enhancing carbon storage and other ecosystem services should focus on both soil protection and maximizing services in living biomass. Our results demonstrate that sustaining tree-produced ecosystem services requires maintenance of large old trees and species diversity, not only in terms of relative abundance, but also relative dominance, and in combination, species-specific size distributions. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.},

	abstract = {This study used tree data from field plots in urban areas to describe forest structure in urban areas throughout California. The plot data were used with numerical models to calculate several ecosystem services produced by trees. A series of transfer functions were calculated to scale-up results from the plots to the landscape using urban tree canopy (UTC) mapped at 1-m resolution for each combination of 6 land use classes and climate zones. California's UTC covered 15% of the urban area and contained 173.2 million trees, five per city resident. UTC per capita was lowest among U.S. states (90.8 m2), indicating ample opportunity for tree planting. Oaks were the most abundant taxon (22%) and overall plantings were youthful. The annual value of ecosystem services was estimated at $8.3 billion and the urban forests asset value was $181 billion. Assuming an average annual per tree management cost of $19 and benefit of $47.83, $2.52 in benefit was returned for every dollar spent. The threat posed by Invasive Shot Hole Borer (Euwallacea sp.) illustrates that urban forests are a relatively fragile resource whose contributions to human health and well-being can be suddenly jeopardized. One scenario projected that should Southern California cities lose 50% (11.6 million) of all susceptible trees, the value of ecoservices foregone over 10 years was $616.6 million. The approximate cost of removing and replacing the trees was $15.9 billion. Strategies to reduce the risk of catastrophic loss by increasing the resilience of California's urban forests are discussed. © 2017},

	abstract = {Urban forests can provide essential environmental and social functions if properly planned and managed. Tree inventories and measurements are a critical part of assessing and monitoring the size, growth, and health condition of urban trees. In this context, the parameters usually collected are diameter at breast height (DBH) and total height, but additional data about crown dimensions (width, length, and crown projection) are required for a comprehensive tree assessment. These data are generally collected by urban foresters through field surveys using tree calipers or diameter tape for DBH and the electronic ipsometer/clinometer to measure tree height and crown size. Greater detail could be achieved using a digital instrument such as Field-Map, a portable computer station, to quickly realize dimensional and topographic surveys of trees and forest stands. Additionally, the incorporation of a LIDAR scanner into a smartphone such as the iPhone 12 Pro has made this device able to measure tree attributes as well as additional spatial data in the field. In this study, we tested these 3 different measurement systems in a field sampling of an urban forest and compared them in terms of measurable parameters, accuracy, cost, and time efficiency. Furthermore, we discussed the pros and cons of each measurement approach and how the resulted data can be used to evaluate ecosystem services of trees and provide guidance on tree management in order to reduce potential risks or disservices. © 2022 International Society of Arboriculture.},

	abstract = {During a time of rapid urban growth and development, it is becoming ever more important to monitor the carbon fluxes of our cities. Unlike Canada’s commercially managed forests that have a long history of inventory and modelling tools, there is both a lack of coordinated data and considerable uncertainty on assessment procedures for urban forest carbon. Nonetheless, independent studies have been carried out across Canada. To improve upon Canada’s federal government reporting on carbon storage and sequestration by urban forests, this study builds on existing data to develop an updated assessment of carbon storage and sequestration for Canada’s urban forests. Using canopy cover estimates derived from ortho-imagery and satellite imagery ranging from 2008 to 2012 and field-based urban forest inventory and assessment data from 16 Canadian cities and one US city, this study found that Canadian urban forests store approximately 27,297.8 kt C (− 37%, + 45%) in above and belowground biomass and sequester approximately 1497.7 kt C year−1 (− 26%, + 28%). In comparison with the previous national assessment of urban forest carbon, this study suggested that in urban areas carbon storage has been overestimated and carbon sequestration has been underestimated. Maximizing urban forest carbon sinks will contribute to Canada’s mitigation efforts and, while being a smaller carbon sink compared to commercial forests, will also provide important ecosystem services and co-benefits to approximately 83% of Canadian people. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Institutional greenspaces such as golf courses, cemeteries, military bases, hospitals, and university campuses are not generally revered for their ecological integrity. The existence of golf courses in particular has been heavily debated due to widespread perceptions of these spaces as environmentally degrading. Though much of the total area of golf courses is occupied by heavily manicured lawns, Canadian golf courses tend to be well treed and thus show significant potential to enhance forest coverage and contribute to the conservation of native tree species when established on previously unforested land. To explore this potential, a tree inventory was carried out on an inner-city golf course in halifax, Nova Scotia, and findings compared to an earlier inventory of more naturalized (i.e., ingrowth) forest areas in the same city. Based in the Acadian Forest Region, this case study used the characteristics of a healthy and mature Acadian Forest as a model for ecological integrity. It was found that both the golf course and the ingrowth populations were largely representative of a mixedwood Acadian forest. Likewise, both populations were in a similar stage of regeneration and exhibited similar stresses. These results suggest that if improved forest management approaches are employed, golf courses will effectively strengthen the ecological integrity of urban forests. This is an especially important finding in the climate change era when tree populations are likely to be subjected to new environmental stressors which may be alleviated via the human intervention that is available on managed lands such as institutional greenspaces. © 2020 by the authors.},

The study authors illustrate how a city can use local, information to compare management plans. Although the simple strategy of treating all ash trees provided the lowest annual, cost and produced, the largest forest, this option was ultimately the most expensive. Simply removing ash trees and replacing them with resistant trees restored the forest to its initial size after 25 years. However, after taking five years to complete tree removal and replacement, the initial ash forest was reduced to a mere 27% of its original size. When, this management plan, was modified, by protecting trees in the median, size class with insecticides, the restoration forest was below 50% of the initial size for two years but at a discounted cost that was only 6% greater than replacing all trees.

Urban plantation has realistic demands for single tree management such as catkin pollution, maintenance of famous trees, landscape construction, and park management. At present, there are problems of missed detection and error detection in dense plantations and complex background plantations. This paper proposes a single tree detection method based on single shot multibox detector (SSD). Optimal SSD is obtained by adjusting feature layers, optimizing the aspect ratio of a preset box, reducing parameters and so on. The optimal SSD is applied to single tree detection and location in campuses, orchards, and economic plantations. The average accuracy based on SSD is 96.0, 92.9, and 97.6% in campus green trees, lychee plantations, and palm plantations, respectively. It is 11.3 and 37.5% higher than the latest template matching method and chan-vese (CV) model method, and is 43.1 and 54.2% higher than the traditional watershed method and local maximum method. Experimental results show that SSD has a strong potential and application advantage. This research has reference significance for the application of an object detection framework based on deep learning in agriculture and forestry. Copyright © 2021 Zheng and Wu.},

	abstract = {Background: Urban trees have long been valued for providing ecosystem services (mitigation of the “heat island” effect, suppression of air pollution, etc.); more recently the potential of urban forests to store significant above ground biomass (AGB) has also be recognised. However, urban areas pose particular challenges when assessing AGB due to plasticity of tree form, high species diversity as well as heterogeneous and complex land cover. Remote sensing, in particular light detection and ranging (LiDAR), provide a unique opportunity to assess urban AGB by directly measuring tree structure. In this study, terrestrial LiDAR measurements were used to derive new allometry for the London Borough of Camden, that incorporates the wide range of tree structures typical of an urban setting. Using a wall-to-wall airborne LiDAR dataset, individual trees were then identified across the Borough with a new individual tree detection (ITD) method. The new allometry was subsequently applied to the identified trees, generating a Borough-wide estimate of AGB. Results: Camden has an estimated median AGB density of 51.6 Mg ha–1 where maximum AGB density is found in pockets of woodland; terrestrial LiDAR-derived AGB estimates suggest these areas are comparable to temperate and tropical forest. Multiple linear regression of terrestrial LiDAR-derived maximum height and projected crown area explained 93% of variance in tree volume, highlighting the utility of these metrics to characterise diverse tree structure. Locally derived allometry provided accurate estimates of tree volume whereas a Borough-wide allometry tended to overestimate AGB in woodland areas. The new ITD method successfully identified individual trees; however, AGB was underestimated by ≤ 25% when compared to terrestrial LiDAR, owing to the inability of ITD to resolve crown overlap. A Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis identified assigning wood density values as the largest source of uncertainty when estimating AGB. Conclusion: Over the coming century global populations are predicted to become increasingly urbanised, leading to an unprecedented expansion of urban land cover. Urban areas will become more important as carbon sinks and effective tools to assess carbon densities in these areas are therefore required. Using multi-scale LiDAR presents an opportunity to achieve this, providing a spatially explicit map of urban forest structure and AGB. © 2018, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Identifying factors that influence the land surface temperature (LST) of urban forests can help improve simulations and predictions of spatial patterns of urban cool islands. This requires a quantitative analytical method that combines spatial statistical analysis with multi-source observational data. The purpose of this study was to reveal how human activities and ecological factors jointly influence LST in clustering regions (hot or cool spots) of urban forests. Using Xiamen City, China from 1996 to 2006 as a case study, we explored the interactions between human activities and ecological factors, as well as their influences on urban forest LST. Population density was selected as a proxy for human activity. We integrated multi-source data (forest inventory, digital elevation models (DEM), population, and remote sensing imagery) to develop a database on a unified urban scale. The driving mechanism of urban forest LST was revealed through a combination of multi-source spatial data and spatial statistical analysis of clustering regions. The results showed that the main factors contributing to urban forest LST were dominant tree species and elevation. The interactions between human activity and specific ecological factors linearly or nonlinearly increased LST in urban forests. Strong interactions between elevation and dominant species were generally observed and were prevalent in either hot or cold spots areas in different years. In conclusion, quantitative studies based on spatial statistics and GeogDetector models should be conducted in urban areas to reveal interactions between human activities, ecological factors, and LST. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Ecosystem modeling can help decision making regarding planting of urban trees for climate change mitigation and air pollution reduction. Algorithms and models that link the properties of plant functional types, species groups, or single species to their impact on specific ecosystem services have been developed. However, these models require a considerable effort for initialization that is inherently related to uncertainties originating from the high diversity of plant species in urban areas. We therefore suggest a new automated method to be used with the i-Tree Eco model to derive light competition for individual trees and investigate the importance of this property. Since competition depends also on the species, which is difficult to determine from increasingly used remote sensing methodologies, we also investigate the impact of uncertain tree species classification on the ecosystem services by comparing a species-specific inventory determined by field observation with a genus-specific categorization and a model initialization for the dominant deciduous and evergreen species only. Our results show how the simulation of competition affects the determination of carbon sequestration, leaf area, and related ecosystem services and that the proposed method provides a tool for improving estimations. Misclassifications of tree species can lead to large deviations in estimates of ecosystem impacts, particularly concerning biogenic volatile compound emissions. In our test case, monoterpene emissions almost doubled and isoprene emissions decreased to less than 10% when species were estimated to belong only to either two groups instead of being determined by species or genus. It is discussed that this uncertainty of emission estimates propagates further uncertainty in the estimation of potential ozone formation. Overall, we show the importance of using an individual light competition approach and explicitly parameterizing all ecosystem functions at the species-specific level. © 2018 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Depression is a common serious mental health condition that can have negative personal and social consequences, and managing it is critical for treating depression patients. Forest therapy is emerging as a promising non-pharmacological intervention to improve mental health. However, although the effectiveness of forest therapy programs using forests far from the city has been proven, it is not well known that urban forests can be easily accessed in daily life. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the effects of an urban forest therapy program on depression symptoms, sleep quality, and somatization symptoms of depression patients. To evaluate this, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design was employed. A total of 47 depression patients participated in this study (22 in the urban forest therapy program group and 25 in the control group). The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15) were administered to each participant to assess the effects of the urban forest therapy program. The results of this study revealed that depression patients in the urban forest therapy program had significantly alleviated depression symptoms and improved sleep quality and somatization symptoms compared to the control group. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the possibility that the urban forest therapy program could be used as an effective non-pharmacological treatment to alleviate depression disorder. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {When conducting urban forest inventories, complete or partial inaccessibility of sample plots results in non-response for a portion of the selected sample. Unfortunately, the non-response is rarely random and thus a potential bias may be imparted in the sample and associated data analyses. In this study, results from an alternative estimation method that employs response homogeneity groups (RHGs) appeared to be more robust to non-random non-response when compared to those of a standard estimation method. Across the six cities studied, the total non-response rates varied from 8.0 to 20.4%. Percent differences between the two methods in estimated number of trees ranged from −0.7 to 12.6%; whereas 1.4 to 14.8% differences were found for tree biomass density. While these differences only approximate the amount of non-response bias present under standard estimation methods, there is a clear indication that misleading results may be obtained if non-response bias is not adequately addressed. By implementing methods that mitigate potential non-response bias, urban forest inventory practitioners would increase the reliability of information used by city planners to make effective management and policy decisions.

	abstract = {Urban forests are often heavily populated by street trees along right-of-ways (ROW), and monitoring efforts can enhance municipal tree management. Terrestrial photogrammetric techniques have been used to measure tree biometry, but have typically used images from various angles around individual trees or forest plots to capture the entire stem while also utilizing local coordinate systems (i.e., non-georeferenced data). We proposed the mobile collection of georeferenced imagery along 100 m sections of urban roadway to create photogrammetric point cloud datasets suitable for measuring stem diameters and attaining positional x and y coordinates of street trees. In a comparison between stationary and mobile photogrammetry, diameter measurements of urban street trees (N = 88) showed a slightly lower error (RMSE = 8.02%) relative to non-mobile stem measurements (RMSE = 10.37%). Tree Y-coordinates throughout urban sites for mobile photogrammetric data showed a lower standard deviation of 1.70 m relative to 2.38 m for a handheld GPS, which was similar for X-coordinates where photogrammetry and handheld GPS coordinates showed standard deviations of 1.59 m and the handheld GPS 2.36 m, respectively-suggesting higher precision for the mobile photogrammetric models. The mobile photogrammetric system used in this study to create georeferenced models for measuring stem diameters and mapping tree positions can also be potentially expanded for more wide-scale applications related to tree inventory and monitoring of roadside infrastructure. © 2019 by the authors.},

To better understand the importance of a forested urban park we employ the Street Tree Resource Assessment Tool for Urban Forest Managers (STRATUM) to investigate the value of services provided by trees in Allan Gardens, a historic public park in downtown Toronto, Canada. A full inventory, conducted in 2008, found 309 trees representing 43 species. Park trees provided 26,326. USD in annual benefits (DOLLAR16,665 environmental; DOLLAR9661 aesthetic) during 2008, and delivered a benefit-to-cost ratio of 3.4:1. Tree size and leaf area are larger in Allan Gardens when compared with trees growing in other Toronto parks and across the city as a whole. The flow of benefits from Allan Gardens' urban forest is heavily dependent upon Norway Maple (Acer platanoides), a finding mirrored across much of Toronto's urban forest. Norway Maple provides the greatest overall annual benefits (DOLLAR4846 total; DOLLAR113 per tree) and as a species contributes 17.5% of the environmental and 20% of aesthetic value provided by trees in the park.

	abstract = {The urban forest provides our communities with a host of benefits through the delivery of ecosystem services. To properly quantify and sustain these benefits, we require a strong baseline understanding of forest structure and diversity. To date, fine-scale work considering urban forest diversity and ecosystem services has often been limited to trees on public land, considering only one or two green space types. However, the governance of urban green spaces means tree species composition is influenced by management decisions at various levels, including by institutions, municipalities, and individual landowners responsible for their care. Using a mixed-method approach combining a traditional field-inventory and community science project, we inventoried urban trees in the residential neighbourhood of Notre-Dame-de-Grȃce, Montreal. We assessed how tree diversity, composition and structure varies across multiple green space types in the public and private domain (parks, institutions, street rights of way and private yards) at multiple scales. We assessed how service-based traits – traits capturing aspects of plant form and functions that urban residents find beneficial – differed across green space types, with implications for the distribution of ecosystem services across the urban landscape. Green space types displayed meaningful differences in tree diversity, structure, and service-based traits. For example, the inclusion of private trees contributed an additional 52 species (>30% of total species) not found in the local public tree inventory. Trees on private land also tended to be smaller than those in the public domain. Beyond patterns of tree richness, size, and abundance we also observed differences in the composition of tree species and service-based traits at site-scales, particularly between street rights-of way and private yards. While species composition varied considerably across street blocks, blocks were very similar to one another in terms of mean service-based traits. Contrastingly, while species composition was similar from yard to yard, yards differed significantly in mean service-based trait values. Our work emphasises that public tree inventories are unlikely to be fully representative of urban forest composition, structure, and benefits, with implications for urban forest management at larger spatial scales. © 2022 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {Statistically-designed inventories and biodiversity monitoring programs are gaining relevance for biological conservation and natural resources management. Mandated periodic surveys provide unique opportunities to identify and satisfy natural resources management information needs. However, this is not an end in itself but rather is the beginning of a process that should lead to sound decision-making in biodiversity conservation. Forest inventories are currently evolving towards multipurpose resource surveys and are broadening their scope in several directions: (i) expansion of the target population to include non-traditional attributes such as trees outside the forest and urban forests; (ii) forest carbon pools and carbon sequestration estimation; (iii) assessment of forest health; and (iv) inclusion of additional variables such as biodiversity attributes that are not directly related to timber assessment and wood harvesting.There is an on-going debate regarding the role of forest inventories in biodiversity assessment and monitoring. This paper presents a review on the topic that aims at providing updated knowledge on the current contribution of forest inventories to the assessment and monitoring of forest biodiversity conditions on a large scale. Specific objectives are fourfold: (i) to highlight the types of forest biodiversity indicators that can be estimated from data collected in the framework of standard forest inventories and the implications of different sampling methods on the estimation of the indicators; (ii) to outline current possibilities for harmonized estimation of biodiversity indicators in Europe from National Forest Inventory data; (iii) to show the added value for forest biodiversity monitoring of framing biodiversity indicators into ecologically meaningful forest type units; and (iv) to examine the potential of forest inventory sample data for estimating landscape biodiversity metrics. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {With the uncertainties that our societies are living with (the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change), it becomes essential to provide urban planners and decision-makers with state-of-theart and user-friendly methodologies to incorporate ecosystem service considerations into their designs for resilient cities. In this regard, urban forests play a crucial role. The quantification of the ecosystem services is geo-specific and needs studies in different urban contexts. At this scope, we evaluated the urban forest of a neighborhood of a densely built-up Italian city (Perugia) with a low level of urban greenery management and with a tree inventory still in progress. Furthermore, we defined a tool helpful in tree-planting decisions and management. This paper involves citizens in field research for trees inventory. Then, it uses i-Tree Eco to evaluate four ecosystem services (carbon storage and sequestration, pollution removal, and runoff avoided) provided by 373 inventoried urban trees belonging to 57 species. Our results show that Italian Municipal tree inventories do not adequately represent their urban forest and that citizens’ participation provides a cost-effective method for integrating field data. Finally, the paper develops an easy tool helping local administrations enhance the ecosystem services provisions in urban green design. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Urban afforestation is considered a promising nature-climate solution that may contribute to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, since it can increase C-storage and C-sequestration, whilst providing further multiple ecosystem services for citizens. However, the quantification of the CO2 sequestration capacity that may be provided by an urban forest as well as the capacity to impact the city-level C-balance and offset anthropogenic emissions is a complex issue. Methodological approaches, quantity and quality of information contained in urban tree database, and the level of detail of the planned urban forest can strongly influence the estimation of C-sequestration potential offered by urban forests. In this work, an integrated framework based on emission inventory, tree species/morphology and ecosystem modelling has been proposed for the city of Prato, Italy, a representative medium size European city to: i) evaluate the current C-sequestration capacity of urban trees; ii) upscale such capacity with different afforestation scenarios, iii) compare the sink capacity offered by ecosystems with current and projected anthropogenic emissions. Results indicated that the green areas within the Municipality of Prato can sequester 33.1 ktCO2 yr−1 under actual conditions and 51.0 ktCO2 yr−1 under the afforestation scenario which maximize the CO2 sequestration capacity, offsetting the 7.1 % and 11 % of the total emissions (465.8 ktCO2 yr−1), respectively. This study proves that, in the various afforestation scenarios tested, the contribution of urban afforestation to the municipality carbon balance is negligible and that carbon neutrality can only be reached by the substantial decarbonization of emission sectors. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

To investigate the contributions of ornamental trees, this study aimed to: (1) assess their provision of ecosystem services; and (2) examine their ecological composition and diversity. Comprehensive tree survey in 93 public housing estates in Hong Kong identified 12,516 ornamental trees. To characterise the ability to provide ecosystem services, an index termed serviceable tree volume was devised. This innovative quantity aided the evaluation of ornamental trees by visual amenities, olfactory trait and ecological benefits while considering the compromise due to structural defects. The comprehensive tree survey showed a significant tendency of planting exotics for ornamental purposes. Most ornamentals could potentially deliver high-quality ecosystem services which were unfortunately restrained by prevailing very poor health conditions particularly attributed to structural defects on major branches. By relative importance value, several species dominated the ornamental tree inventory, namely Bauhinia ‘Blakeana’, Delonix regia and Bombax ceiba. By incorporating serviceable tree volume in calculating relative importance value, the importance ranking of ornamental species was re-ordered. Using tree stem as the unit of analysis, Shannon-Wiener Diversity, Reciprocal Simpson and Pielou's Evenness of the ornamental tree stock stood at 3.08, 14.73 and 0.74 respectively, and they were reduced when the three indices incorporated serviceable tree volume. Diverse native ornamentals could be planted extensively in the urban forest in tandem with the preservation of important exotic species. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {The urban forest is becoming increasingly important in the contexts of urban green space, carbon sequestration and offsets, and socio-economic impacts. This has led to a recent increase in attention being paid to urban environmental management. Tree biomass, specifically, is a vital indicator of carbon storage and has a direct impact on urban forest health and carbon sequestration. As an alternative to expensive and time-consuming field surveys, remote sensing has been used extensively in measuring dynamics of vegetation and estimating biomass. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) has proven especially useful to characterize the three dimensional (3D) structure of forests. In urban contexts however, information is frequently required at the individual tree level, necessitating the proper delineation of tree crowns. Yet, crown delineation is challenging for urban trees where a wide range of stress factors and cultural influences affect growth. In this paper high resolution LiDAR data were used to infer biomass based on individual tree attributes. A multi-tiered delineation algorithm was designed to extract individual tree-crowns. At first, dominant tree segments were obtained by applying watershed segmentation on the crown height model (CHM). Next, prominent tree top positions within each segment were identified via a regional maximum transformation and the crown boundary was estimated for each of the tree tops. Finally, undetected trees were identified using a best-fitting circle approach. After tree delineation, individual tree attributes were used to estimate tree biomass and the results were validated with associated field mensuration data. Results indicate that the overall tree detection accuracy is nearly 80%, and the estimated biomass model has an adjusted-R2 of 0.5. © 2015 SPIE.},

Assessing the carbon offsets associated with urban trees relative to other climate change policies is vital for sustainable development, planning, and solving environmental and socio-economic problems, but is difficult in developing countries. We estimated and assessed carbon dioxide (CO2) storage, sequestration, and emission offsets by public trees in the Medellin Metropolitan Area, Colombia, as a viable Nature-Based Solution for the Neotropics. While previous studies have discussed nature-based solutions and explored urban tree carbon dynamics in high income countries, few have been conducted in tropical cities in low-middle income countries, particularly within South America. We used a public tree inventory for the Metropolitan Area of the Aburrá Valley and an available urban forest functional model, i-Tree Streets, calibrated for Colombia's context. We found that CO2 offsets from public trees were not as effective as cable cars or landfills. However, if available planting spaces are considered, carbon offsets become more competitive with cable cars and other air quality and socio-economic co-benefits are also provided. The use of carbon estimation models and the development of relevant carbon accounting protocols in Neotropical cities are also discussed. Our nature-based solution approach can be used to better guide management of urban forests to mitigate climate change and carbon offset accounting in tropical cities lacking available information. © 2017 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Urban forest and relevant management policies have been widely considered as a tool to mitigate carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. However, the urban forest structure, function and role in carbon(C) offsets of Chinese urban forests are little understood. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the C storage and sequestration by urban forests and C emissions from energy consumption by urban energy consumption in Guangzhou, and analyse the effect of urban forests offsetting the C emissions from energy use. This paper also discussed the relationship between urban low carbon development and forest C sink, and explored the management practices for improving Guangzhou's urban forest function of offsetting C emissions. Guangzhou is located in north side of the Pearl River, along southeastern coast of China. The forests in Guangzhou includes five main types: Eucalyptus, Plus massoniana, Cunninghamia lanceolata, economic forest and evergreen broad-leaved forest. C storage and sequestration were quantified using urban forest inventory data and by applying volume-derived biomass equations and other models related to net primary productivity (NPP). C emissions from urban energy use were estimated by accounting for fossil fuel use and C emission factors. Total C storage by Guangzhou's urban forests was estimated at 654.42×104 t, and average C density was 28.81 t/ hm2. C storage in different districts ranged from 1.50×104 t to 354.99×104 t, as in the following order: Conghua>Zengcheng>Huadu>Baiyun>Luogang>Panyu>Tianhe> Huangpu. C storage of evergreen broad-leaved forest and young age class forest were respectively 530.67×104 t and 271.86× 104 t, which had played a chief role in forest total C storage in terms of forest type and age class. C sequestration by urban forests was 658,732 t/ a, with an average C sequestration rate was 2. 90 t·hm-2·a-1. The spatial distribution of C sequestration in Guangzhou was imbalanced: most of C was sequestrated in exurb just like Conghua and Zengcheng. The C sequestration percentages of Eucalyptus, Plus massoniana, Cunninghamia lanceolata, economic forest and evergreen broad- leaved forest were 6.25%, 8.13%, 3.67%, 1.48% and 82.25% respectively. C sequestration rate decreased with increasing forest age. For Eucalyptus, C sequestration for young, middle-aged, premature, mature and post-mature forests decreased with age from 3.06 t·hm-2·a-1 to 2.35 t·hm-2·a-1. Results were similar for Plus massoniana which decreased from 1.99 t·hm-2·a-1 to 1.34 t·hm-2·a-1, for Cunninghamia lanceolata from 4.06 t·hm-2·a-1 to 2.61 t·hm-2·a-1, and for evergreen broad-leaved forest from 4.17 t·hm-2·a-1 to 3.68 t·hm-2·a-1. Average annual C emissions of urban energy use from 2005 to 2010 in Guangzhou were 2907.41×104 t. Therefore, the C stored by urban forests equaled 22.51% of the average annual C emission from fossil fuel use, and C sequestration could offset 2.27% of the average annual C emission in Guangzhou. Urban forest's C sequestration had a small contribution on urban carbon reduction, but it is still one of the important measures of low carbon development from its comprehensive benefits such as releasing Oxygen, air purification, VOC(volatile organic compounds)management, stormwater runoff capture, building energy saving, aesthetics and recreation. Furthermore, this paper also analyzed the impacts of forest composition and forest age structure on C storage and sequestration of urban forests in Guangzhou, and gave suggestions on improving forest C sink to enhance C offset effect through the forest management.},

	abstract = {Chile's capital in the Metropolitan Region has an atmosphere polluted especially by particulate matter in winter and by ozone in summer. Trees are used as a natural strategy for decontamination; however, they emit biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) whose atmospheric reactions generate secondary chemical species, including ozone. This study presents the experimental emission factors (EF) of BVOCs in young and adult individuals of three native trees (Cryptocarya alba, Quillaja saponaria and Schinus molle) and one non-native (Quercus suber). To distinguish the environmental impact of the young and adult individuals studied, the EF and the Photochemical Ozone Creation Index (POCI) were calculated. Results show that the concentrations of isoprene emitted by the trees studied (young or adult) correlated with neither PAR nor temperature in autumn, monoterpenes correlated with PAR and/or temperature (young or adult), but the specific monoterpene depended on the tree species. The open question is how much would be necessary to normalize the EF in order to obtain better values for introducing an emission inventory which elaborated more reliable decontamination strategies.},

But greenness is often unevenly distributed across a city, raising environmental justice issues. In 2011 and 2012 the USDA Forest Service, Forest Inventory and Analysis program installed ground plots in the urbanized areas of Oregon and Washington. We analyze these data for the urban areas west of the Cascade Mountains, linking it with demographic data from the U.S. Census to examine the relationship between greenness and socioeconomic status at a sub-regional scale. To explore some relations between urban forest measures and socioeconomic conditions and measures we developed four models: presence of tree canopy cover with a logistic mixed model, and on a subset of the data, percent tree canopy cover with a linear mixed model and tree count and tree species count with Poisson mixed models. We found that median household income, house value, land use, and years in the Tree City USA program contributed to explaining measures of greenness, such as canopy cover presence, percent canopy cover, tree counts, and tree species counts. This agrees with other studies, but does so at a broad scale covering the most densely populated areas in the Pacific Northwest. © 2016.},

	abstract = {A study of reasons why people volunteer for urban forestry projects, and of their task preferences, compared the opinions and attitudes of volunteers with those of people in botanical organizations who might be considered likely targets for recruitment. A mail survey used membership lists of two tree volunteer organizations and one botanical garden in New York City, as well as one tree volunteer organization and one arboretum in Philadelphia. Members of the three tree volunteer organizations had completed a training course on tree care or inventory, and may not be representative of volunteers typically involved in single-day projects. Collectively, 1,038 people were sampled and 63% responded. Tree volunteers were predominately white, middle aged, well educated, and financially middle class. Improving one's neighborhood was the main reason for volunteering, followed by desire for education; social interaction was only moderately important. Respondents from all organizations considered tree care to be the most important urban forestry task. Volunteers thought tree care would provide the greatest personal satisfaction compared to other tasks, while potential volunteers thought planting trees would be most satisfying. Education was regarded as a highly important task to gain public support, even more important than tree planting. Respondents were least willing, by a large margin, to engage in fundraising or lobbying politicians. Both volunteers and potential volunteers were willing to perform a wider range of tasks than they have performed already, suggesting strong potential for increased involvement. Tree volunteers expressed a strong desire to increase their level of participation in the planning and decision-making of their projects. Less than half of the volunteers thought they had been recognized for their work in some way, but recognition was mostly viewed as unimportant. Respondents from all organizations felt that their urban forest was in rather poor condition, and that volunteers are needed to improve their city's trees. Four-fifths of potential volunteers have volunteered before in some way, indicating a general willingness for voluntary action by members of botanical organizations. Many current tree volunteers were self-motivated in seeking volunteer involvement; i.e., they responded to media announcements and volunteered without being personally asked. However, personal contact with potential volunteers is an effective recruitment technique for expanding the pool of volunteers beyond this self-selected group, as well as for increasing diversity.},

Terminalia catappa trees are commonly used in the urban forest composition in the world and it is the most frequent species of street trees in Itanhaém, Brazil. This study aimed to evaluate individuals of the species in the municipality's street trees in order to determine the dendrometric characteristics, practiced pruning modalities, and the main structural defects shown. The results showed that the trees are on average 7.5 m in height, with DBH of 0.30 m and crown radius of 4.5 m. Approximately 75 % of individuals were pruned, with reduction and lifting pruning being the most frequent. The main structural defects found were dry branches in the crown (89.2 %), cracks in the soil caused by the roots (70.3 %) and bacterial galls on the trunk (48.6 %). The analysis of the associations showed that there is an association linking pruning to epicormic shoots and to dry branches. The size of the trees is incompatible with urban infrastructure, showing that sidewalks are not an appropriate site for the species. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH},

Using a random sampling method on the urban divisions of the city, the species and number of tree, height, diameter, crown coverage, damages and affectations to the urban infrastructure were determined. A total of 7539 trees, distributed in 38 families, 88 genders and 114 species were recorded; 74% of the individuals are introduced, most of the trees have physical and sanitary conditions from regular to good, the most frequent damages are the lifting of sidewalks, exposed roots and interference with aerial wiring. Through this study, the importance of the role that trees play in the cities is confirmed. To ensure the ability to provide environmental services and ensure their sustainability, it is necessary to incorporate integrated management programs for urban trees at the municipal level. Finally, it is important to highlight that in the cities the damage caused to nature due to poorly planned urbanization and accelerated demographic growth are more evident. Undoubtedly, the citizens are the main modelers of change in the urban environment, influencing directly its development. © 2019, Instituto de Ecologia, A.C. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Research on the effects of urban sprawl on carbon stocks within urban forests can help support policy for sustainable urban design. This is particularly important given climate change and environmental deterioration as a result of rapid urbanization. The purpose of this study was to quantify the effects of urban sprawl on dynamics of forest carbon stock and density in Xiamen, a typical city experiencing rapid urbanization in China. Forest resource inventory data collected from 32,898 patches in 4 years (1972, 1988, 1996 and 2006), together with remotely sensed data (from 1988, 1996 and 2006), were used to investigate vegetation carbon densities and stocks in Xiamen, China. We classified the forests into four groups: (1) forest patches connected to construction land; (2) forest patches connected to farmland; (3) forest patches connected to both construction land and farmland and (4) close forest patches. Carbon stocks and densities of four different types of forest patches during different urbanization periods in three zones (urban core, suburb and exurb) were compared to assess the impact of human disturbance on forest carbon. In the urban core, the carbon stock and carbon density in all four forest patch types declined over the study period. In the suburbs, different urbanization processes influenced forest carbon density and carbon stock in all four forest patch types. Urban sprawl negatively affected the surrounding forests. In the exurbs, the carbon stock and carbon density in all four forest patch types tended to increase over the study period. The results revealed that human disturbance played the dominant role in influencing the carbon stock and density of forest patches close to the locations of human activities. In forest patches far away from the locations of human activities, natural forest regrowth was the dominant factor affecting carbon stock and density. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this article, we propose an approach to delineate and map the crown of 15 tree species in the city of Duhok, Kurdistan Region of Iraq using WorldView-2 (WV-2) imagery. A tree crown object is identified first and is subsequently delineated as an image object (IO) using vegetation indices and texture measurements. Next, three classification methods: Maximum Likelihood, Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine were used to classify IOs using selected IO features. The best results are obtained with Support Vector Machine classification that gives the best map of urban tree species in Duhok. The overall accuracy was between 60.93% to 88.92% and °-coefficient was between 0.57 to 0.75. We conclude that fifteen tree species were identified and mapped at a satisfactory accuracy in urban areas of this study.},

	abstract = {Around the world, urban landscapes are environments modified by man, generally related to low diversity. The efficiency of a biodiversity inventory is linked to the choice of the sampling technique since the taxonomic and ecological responses of the taxons vary between methods. Here we investigate differences in the ant's composition sampled using three different techniques in two fragments of the urban forest in the Brazilian Amazon. We also assessed whether the different techniques maintained the same ecological responses. We sampled 12 collection points at each fragment, at vegetation, and manual collection and Winkler extractor on the ground. At the same points, soil samples were collected to determine their granulometry, pH, and concentrations of organic matter, sodium, phosphorus, and potassium. We collected 115 taxa and 4720 ants. The Cururu was the richest site with more species in general, as well as in the techniques of manual collection and Winkler. We detected a complementary effect on sampling techniques, which collected different ants' assemblages. The potassium concentration positively influenced the assemblage's composition, but its effect varies according to the sampling techniques used. The studied fragments revealed diversity very similar to those registered in continuous Amazonian forests. The use of sampling techniques together improves the representation of the diversity of ants in the studied fragments. Edaphic environmental variables seem to have a predominant effect on ants, affecting their distribution in the landscape even in urban fragments. This highlights the importance of urban forest fragments and their inherent ecological processes. © 2020 Universidade Estadual de Feira de Santana. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {At the beginning of the 1900s, the Canberra plain was largely treeless. Graziers had carried out extensive clearing of the original trees since the 1820s leaving only scattered remnants and some plantings near homesteads. With the selection of Canberra as the site for the new capital of Australia, extensive tree plantings began in 1911. These trees have delivered a number of benefits, including aesthetic values and the amelioration of climatic extremes. Recently, however, it was considered that the benefits might extend to pollution mitigation and the sequestration of carbon. This paper outlines a case study of the value of the Canberra urban forest with particular reference to pollution mitigation. This study uses a tree inventory, modelling and decision support system developed to collect and use data about trees for tree asset management. The decision support system (DISMUT) was developed to assist in the management of about 400,000 trees planted in Canberra. The size of trees during the 5-year Kyoto Commitment Period was estimated using DISMUT and multiplied by estimates of value per square meter of canopy derived from available literature. The planted trees are estimated to have a combined energy reduction, pollution mitigation and carbon sequestration value of US$20-67 million during the period 2008-2012. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract = {Forests are important to nutrient cycling, hydrology, climate and aesthetics in urban ecosystems. Effective forest management in urban environments requires detailed data on the spatial distribution and structure of urban forests, but the lidar which are best for mapping the complexity of these forests are often unavailable or prohibitively expensive for municipalities. However, leaf-off small footprint lidar originally collected for topographic mapping are increasingly available, and will soon become accessible to forest managers in the U.S. through 3DEP (3D Elevation Program). In this paper, we demonstrated the opportunistic use of existing leaf-off lidar to map forest structure and associated uncertainties in Madison, Wisconsin and neighboring municipalities. Using empirical models, we were able to map five structural variables and aboveground biomass with accuracies comparable to or better than other studies using comparable data and with errors generally <20 % of the data range. Highest uncertainties in our forest structure maps occurred in residential neighborhoods and along forest edges. From the results, we present maps of forest structure and, to our knowledge, first of a kind pixel-wise uncertainty maps for an urban area. These maps provide the basis for a spatially comprehensive assessment of forest resources and are effective for urban inventory and change assessment. For example, the maps enabled comprehensive comparison of carbon storage by urban trees among cities, with a range in our study of 1.2 kg/m2 to 5.6 kg/m2, and with major variations due to differences in city development patterns and ages. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {Research that illuminates causes of urban forest storm damage is valuable for planning and management. However, logistical and safety concerns often delay post-storm surveys in urban areas; thus, surveys may include observations with unverified sources of damage. While this uncertainty is often ignored, it can make up a high proportion of the number of damaged trees. The goal of this research was to improve understanding of techniques for modeling storm damage in urban forests. Using urban forest storm damage inventories collected in Florida, post-Hurricane Irma (2017), we tested how different imputation methods, modeling procedures, and damage frequency levels could impact overall model results. We utilized machine learning algorithms Random Forest (RF) and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and generalized linear models (GLM). We found that GLM and RF models gave overall unbiased predictions of damage across all methods and rarity levels, while KNN consistently under-predicted damage. Damage frequency influenced some measures of performance but did not impact variable significance. Imputation methods all identified consistent variables of most significance within each model procedure; however, there was variation among variables ranked moderately important. While both GLM and RF models identified plot tree basal area as highly significant damage predictors, they otherwise disagreed on individual variable importance. These findings suggest that while explanatory models for urban forest storm damage can be achieved by examining linear relationships, more complex relationships such as the ones identified by RF models can have equal explanatory power with different subsets of predictor variables. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Urban forests are an important part of any city, given that they provide several environmental benefits, such as improving urban drainage, climate regulation, public health, biodiversity, and others. However, tree detection in cities is challenging, given the irregular shape, size, occlusion, and complexity of urban areas. With the advance of environmental technologies, deep learning segmentation mapping methods can map urban forests accurately. We applied a region-based CNN object instance segmentation algorithm for the semantic segmentation of tree canopies in urban environments based on aerial RGB imagery. To the best of our knowledge, no study investigated the performance of deep learning-based methods for segmentation tasks inside the Cerrado biome, specifically for urban tree segmentation. Five state-of-the-art architectures were evaluated, namely: Fully Convolutional Network; U-Net; SegNet; Dynamic Dilated Convolution Network and DeepLabV3+. The experimental analysis showed the effectiveness of these methods reporting results such as pixel accuracy of 96,35%, an average accuracy of 91.25%, F1-score of 91.40%, Kappa of 82.80% and IoU of 73.89%. We also determined the inference time needed per area, and the deep learning methods investigated after the training proved to be suitable to solve this task, providing fast and effective solutions with inference time varying from 0.042 to 0.153 minutes per hectare. We conclude that the semantic segmentation of trees inside urban environments is highly achievable with deep neural networks. This information could be of high importance to decision-making and may contribute to the management of urban systems.

	abstract = {Trees are one of the few carbon sinks in urban areas. Different methods are available to assess the biomass of urban trees, one of these being allometric biomass functions. Biomass functions are well investigated, reliable and easy to apply if the required information is available. Our goal is to use biomass functions to enhance urban forest management tools with information on stored biomass and carbon. In this study, we test several approaches to estimate new species-specific biomass functions. We include data from urban and traditional forest trees since both origins can be modeled by the allometric relationship solely giving different parameter estimates. The tested models include mixed allometric models for urban trees only, the adjustments of available forest tree biomass models and a cross-classified mixed model (CCMM) using both data from urban and forest trees. We then show by cross validation that the CCMM, statistically separating the data into different species and origins, shows greater improvement over the simpler models. Hence, we state that the inclusion of forest tree data improves the performance on biomass predictions for urban trees: the urban tree biomass functions “learned from forest trees”. The CCMM is also compared against the predictions of the above-ground biomass functions applied in the German National Forest Inventory. Comparable RMSE and slightly lower BIAS values are found, both for deciduous and coniferous tree species. With the approach of a cross-classified model, we also enable predictions for non-observed conifers in urban space, assuming comparable growth differences between deciduous and conifer species in forest stands and urban areas. A sample application using the CCMM model shows results for a small subset of data of an urban tree inventory, collected in a residential area in the city of Munich, Germany. It is applied to estimate carbon storage at two points in time and, hence, carbon fluxes in the period under consideration. Such information can help in the decision making and management of urban trees. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This study has applied an integrated airborne laser scanning (ALS) and geographic information systems (GIS) technique to estimate urban tree damages caused by an ice storm that affected the City of Norman, Oklahoma between 8 and 11th of December, 2007. Pre- and post-storm ALS data were collected and processed using GIS. The pre-storm ALS data was used to create a digital elevation model (DEM) and the pre-storm digital surface model (DSM) while the post-storm DSM was created from post-storm ALS data. The DEM were subtracted from the two DSMs to create the pre- and post-storm canopy height models (CHMs). Individual and grouped trees were then separated using a combination of Koukoulas and Blackburn and local maxima tree extraction algorithms. Finally, differences in height and canopy diameter between the pre- and post-storm CHMs within the extracted trees were calculated to measure the damage. Results showed that approximately 9% of the urban trees were completely damaged while almost 6% did not sustain any damage. It also showed that tree damage from ice storms varied with species and that Acer saccarinum, Acer saccharum Marsh, Ulmus americana, and Ulmus pumila were most vulnerable while Platanus occidentalis and Quercus palustris were the most resilient tree species to the ice storm. When compared with the ground reference data, it was found that the proposed methodology can detect tree height/stem damage with >81% accuracy compared to >42% accuracy in canopy damage assessment. Once ALS data is collected after a disaster, the methodology can provide a quick estimate of urban tree damage and hence be useful for city planners. It can also be used to create detailed inventories of tree heights of urban forests and monitor their growth and changes to improve their long-term sustainability. © 2015 Elsevier GmbH.},

Continued provision of these benefits depends on the health and sustainability of these trees, which depends in turn on tree managers having the type of information usually found in a tree inventory. The city of Ithaca, New York, USA possesses 7 inventories of its street and park trees dating back to 1902. This paper uses the data contained in these inventories to assess the health and sustainability of the city’s street and park tree populations. Attention is given to the structure of these populations with emphasis placed on species and genera diversity and DBH size class distributions. Prior to 1987, the city’s municipal tree population was dominated by a few species, such as Norway maple (Acer platanoides), and genera such as maples (Acer) and elms (Ulmus), and the DBH size class distribution was skewed unsustainably towards older trees. From 1987 onwards, new plantings have significantly increased species and genera diversity, and the DBH size class distribution suggests sufficient younger trees to account for tree mortality and removals. These changes did not occur quickly due to the persistent legacy effect of past planting preferences and practices, but required a consistent effort by municipal tree managers over many years. As a result, based on an analysis of the most recent tree inventory conducted in 2019, the city’s street and park trees and the benefits they provide look to be on a more sustainable footing, although challenges still remain. ©2021 International Society of Arboriculture.},

	abstract = {Understanding the potential dynamics of tree pests and pathogens is a vital component for creating resilient urban treescapes. Epidemiologically relevant features include differences in environmental stress and tree management between street and garden trees, and variation in the potential for human-mediated spread due to intensity of human activity, traffic flow and buildings. We extend a standard spatially explicit raster-based model for pest and pathogen spread by dividing the urban tree population into roadside trees and park/garden trees. We also distinguish between naturally-driven radial spread of pests and pathogens and human-mediated linear spread along roads. The model behaviour is explored using landscape data for tree locations in an exemplar UK town. Two main sources of landscape data were available: commercially collated aerial data, which have high coverage but no information on species; and, an urban tree inventory, with low, non-random, coverage but with some species data. The data were insufficient to impute a species-specific host landscape accurately; however, by combining the two data sources, and applying either random or Matérn cluster point process driven selection of a subset of all trees, we create two sets of potential host landscapes. We find that combining the two mechanisms of dispersal has a non-additive effect, with the enhanced linear dispersal enabling new foci of infection to be established more rapidly than with radial dispersal alone; and clustering of trees by species slows down the expansion of epidemics when compared with random distribution of tree species within known host locations. © 2023},

	abstract = {Street trees have aesthetic, environmental, human health, and economic benefits in urban ecosystems. Street tree populations are constructed by cycles of planting, growth, death, removal and replacement. The goals of this study were to understand how tree mortality and planting rates affect net population growth, evaluate the shape of the mortality curve, and assess selected risk factors for survival. We monitored a street tree population in West Oakland, CA for 5 years after an initial inventory (2006). We adapted the classic demographic balancing equation to quantify annual inputs and outputs to the system, tracking pools of live and standing dead trees. There was a 17.2 % net increase in live tree counts during the study period (995 in 2006, 1166 in 2011), with population growth observed each year. Of the live trees in 2006, 822 survived to 2011, for an annual mortality rate of 3.7 %. However, population growth was constrained by high mortality of young/small trees. Annual mortality was highest for small trees, and lower for mid-size and large trees; this represents a Type III mortality curve. We used multivariate logistic regression to evaluate the relationship between 2011 survival outcomes and inventory data from 2006. In the final model, significant associations were found for size class, foliage condition, planting location, and a multiplicative interaction term for size and foliage condition. Street tree populations are complex cultivated systems whose dynamics can be understood by a combination of longitudinal data and demographic analysis. Urban forest monitoring is important to understand the impact of tree planting programs. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York (outside the USA).},

	abstract = {Many saproxylic beetles (those that live on dead wood) are confined to old trees. Because old trees have generally decreased drastically in number, many of these beetles are now red-listed, which means that they are on a list of species that are considered threatened by extinction from the area (often a country) that the list covers. Beetles dependent on old trees are found primarily in small remnants of semi-natural forests or on grazed land with old trees. However, parks around castles and manor houses also often contain old trees. This paper presents an inventory of saproxylic beetles in one such old, baroque park with an approximately 300 year-old avenue of lime (Tilia cordata) trees. The results are compared with a similar inventory of the most species-rich, old-tree site within the same region. It is a semi-natural forest, partly grazed, containing a number of old oaks. In the park, 18 red-listed beetle species were found - just a few less than the 22 found in the semi-natural forest. The results suggest that parks with old trees may be valuable sources of biodiversity. Because the number of old trees has decreased in the landscape generally, the remaining trees have become more important for the survival of the fauna associated with them. Cultural and biological values could be combined because both may be enhanced by retaining old trees. © 2004 International Society of Arboriculture.},

	abstract = {Urban forest surveillance relies on several aspects that involve the analysis of green area preservation and the monitoring of individual trees. Urban trees are essential to maintain the good quality of the cities and reduce the effects of carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere. In this sense, one can cite the tree species diversity as essential to ensuring the preservation and proper functioning of the urban ecosystem and the conservation of the wildlife species in the urban forest environment. Furthermore, tree species play an essential role in assessing the tree risk of falling since the species are related to the wood density, thus providing further details for the tree structural analysis. However, tree species classification involves a time-consuming process that requires allocating human resources for fieldwork. Also, the tree species are quite imbalanced in the urban landscape, requiring a more efficient approach to provide accurate results for minority species. Therefore, computer-aided methods are helpful to support the rapid analysis of the tree species for tasks involving inventory and analysis of the tree conditions. This paper proposes a multiclass extension of the O2 PF, an Optimum-Path Forest-based oversampling method, to generate synthetic samples based on features extracted from images of five urban tree species. Further, we present the so-called 'Street Level Tree Species Classification', a novel dataset for tree species classification based on tree images from the ground-view perspective. Four variants of the multiclass O2 PF were tested and compared to several state-of-the-art oversampling methods found in the literature. The obtained results confirm the effectiveness and superior accuracy of the proposed approaches in most cases.  © 2022 IEEE.},

The study is based on the forest park stands inventory data, performed from 2012 to 2017 in Kryvyi Rih City, Central Ukraine. The floristic compositions of the urban forest park stands are poor. There are only 23 species that belong to 14 families and 12 genera. More families were represented by at least more than 2% of taxon diversity. While Ulmaceae (2 genera, 4 species–17,39 %), Fabaceae (3 genera, 2 species–17,39 %), Aсеrасеае (1 genera, 4 species–17,39 %) were the most representative families. It was established that at forest park the values of stand density varied from 490 to 660 trees*ha-1, stem heights were from 26 to 31 m, stem diameters were from 13 to 17 cm, stand basal area were from 32 to 49 m2*ha-1, stand volume were from 200 to 415 m3*ha-1. the values of relative stem heights were from 0,63 to 0,82 m*year-1, relative stem diameters were from 0,31 to 0,43 cm*year-1, relative stand basal area were from 0,80 to 1,19 m2*ha-1*year-1, relative stand volume were from 5,45 to 10,28 m3*ha-1*year-1. The varied values of the forest park stands index (Shannon-Wiener diversity index from 0,75 to 1,61, Pielou's evenness index from 0,53 to 0,86, Simpson's diversity from 0,24 to 0,60, Margalef's diversity index from 0,87 to 6,97) indicate the ecological instability of these woody plant communities.

Hawassa city, Ethiopia, is greatly affected by rapid urbanisation. Hence, this study’s aim was to assess the role of green infrastructure in woody species diversity and carbon stock in Hawassa city. A cluster sampling methodwas used to classifythe existing green infrastructure. Two hundred and forty sample plots were used to compile a woody species inventory and for soil sampling. Fifty eight woody species belonging to 44 genera and 28 families were recorded; 67.25% of these were exotics. The highest Shannon–Wiener diversity was in private and public institution compounds (mean 1.35) and the least was street trees (0.68). The highest mean biomass carbon was recorded in street trees (167.5 t C ha−1) and the lowest in urban forest (11.4 t C ha−1).  Soil organic carbon accounted for 90% of ecosystem carbon stocks for urban forest, 60% for private public institution, 57% for urban church forest and 37% for street trees. Generally, there is lower species diversity, a dominance of exotic species. Planting diverse and indigenous species should be the next priority. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group and Arboricultural Association.},

A total of 621 trees were assessed, comprising 92 species. Spathodea campanulata and Olea africana accounted for 29.2% and 11.5% of trees in LTT and UNIVEN, respectively. The average tree density was higher in UNIVEN (366.82/km) compared to LTT (115.03/km). Percentages of healthy trees were high in LTT (65.9%) and UNIVEN (75.7%). Caesalpinia ferrea ranked first in both locations in the critical stability class. Only LTT had 1% of trees in the severe hazard category. Common structural defects in the severe hazard class include basal decay, excessive lean, and weak branches.

	abstract = {Urban forests provide ecosystem services for millions of people. Numerous introductions have elevated tree species richness in cities, which may enhance functional diversity. However, few studies have examined changes in tree community composition or functional diversity with urbanization, even though functional diversity, and not species number per se, is directly linked with ecosystem function and associated services. We combined tree abundance data from both urban and extra-urban forest inventory plots for seven metropolitan areas in eastern North America to analyze changes in species composition, Shannon's diversity, and functional diversity with urbanization. As expected, urban tree diversity was reduced at local scales, and the effect varied with land use. Rarefaction analysis indicated that at large scales, urban tree species pools were equal with respect to species or functional diversity compared to extra-urban forests, but in urban areas at small scales this diversity is not realized because of low tree density. Ordination revealed that with urbanization, introduced species increased in importance, and regional variation in species composition became more homogenous. Increasing tree density and/or tree cover through changes in management practices and urban design could facilitate local scale urban tree diversity using existing species pools, which are functionally diverse. Monitoring of forests at large spatial scales that include urban areas, and the use of methods that account for abundance and functional trait variation can provide insights into the effects of urbanization on tree diversity at multiple scales. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

The authors found that data from urban tree inventories are currently being employed in research with an increasing number of focuses across a geographical scope that spans all continents except Africa. Four main types of urban tree inventories were distinguished: satellite-supported methods, airplane-supported methods, on-the-ground scanning or digital photography, and field surveys. Compiling results across studies and evaluating the parameters collected by these inventory methods and their accuracy of measurement revealed that the technology itself and current data processing methods limit the reliability of the data obtained from all methods except field surveys.

	abstract = {This paper evaluates the structure of street and park trees in Boston's neighborhoods of Roxbury and North Dorchester. The general hypothesis is that forest structures of two components of the public urban forest, street and park trees, are significantly different such that they may warrant different policy and management strategies. Data from an inventory of the neighborhoods in 1988-1989 include species, diameter at breast height, and condition of each tree. Descriptive variables calculated from the data include species diversity, size class diversity, percentage of the tress that are in good condition, and species importance lists. From the descriptive variables, size class diversity is greater for street than for park trees. Species diversity and percentage of trees in good condition are greater for park than for street trees. Results from chi-square analyses on tree condition, size class categories, and size class categories for Acer platanoides and Quercus rubra for Condition Class 3 all reject the null hypothesis that street and park tree populations are distributed similarly. A comparison of the importance lists that include the species that collectively make up 75% of all individuals and total basal area shows that there are only seven species required to reach that percentage for street trees, and 14 for park trees. At the 75% level, all species that make up at least 5% of all individuals and total basal area are included. Of the seven tree species on the importance list for street trees, only one is a member of the presettlement forest and all are tolerant of urban environmental stress. For park trees, over half of the 14 species on the importance list are members of the presettlement forest, and at least seven are tolerant of urban environmental stress. The results indicate that street and park trees are distinct populations within urban forests, and hence the processes acting to create these two components of the urban forest resource may also differ. © 1994.},

	abstract = {Social forest functions including recreation are important for increasingly urbanised societies. For effective management of forest recreation areas, monitoring visitor frequencies is crucial. Increasingly, attempts are being made to incorporate recreational use data into National Forest Inventories (NFI), but given the large scale of national assessments, such data is often elusive. In this study we explore the potential of geotagged social media data for assessing visitor frequencies and explore recreational activities through text-based social media data. We analysed data from Twitter, Flickr and Instagram, both at local scale for 10 NFI forest sites, as well as at national scale to assess recreational use. Data availability was significantly correlated between the three platforms, even though absolute counts differed markedly. The model of recreational visitation based on social media data correlated significantly with an existing potential recreational model, indicating that social media data are a valid source of information for recreational use and can be used in future studies to assess recreational potential. Although data availability limits assessments for small areas of forests, large scale assessments using social media are feasible, and provide a potentially more empirically grounded assessment of recreational potential than theoretical models alone. We suggest that future work should aim at integrating social media data into traditional theoretical recreational models as part of a method triangulation, particularly for areas where recreational usage by visitors is high, but population counts are low. However, because social media data are provided by commercial platforms, we believe that more research is needed into harvesting and analysing other forms of content generated by users to decrease the dependency on commercial social media platforms that may or may not be available in the long run, and can be run locally or through central organisations involved in forest and landscape monitoring and observation. © 2021 The Authors},

This analysis showed the Tokyo metropolitan area has 420,564 street trees planted along 2,712 km of streets and about 1.5 million trees occur in 4,177 ha of urban parks in Tokyo. Some 14 per cent of the urbanized portion of the Tokyo metropolitan area is in tree or other types of urban vegetation cover. Commonly observed street and park trees include ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba L.), oriental plane (Platanus orientalis L.), trident maple (Acer buergerianum Miq.), flowering dogwood (Cornus florida L.), yoshino cherry (Prunus yedoensis Matsum.), Japanese zelkova (Zelkova serrata Makino), Japanese pagoda tree (Sophora japonica L.), camphor trees (Cinnamomum camphora Sieb.), Japanese tanoak (Lithocarpus edulis Nakai) and Japanese wax myrtle (Myrica rubra Sieb. et Zucc.). The Japan Greenery Research and Development Center Foundation, established in 1973, has provided valuable leadership to the overall management of the urban forest in the Tokyo metropolitan area. The current recession in Japan is having a serious impact on budgets for the establishment and management of trees in the Tokyo metropolitan area.

	abstract = {Urban greenness is an element of vital importance for the population quality of life, and forest inventory is considered the most appropriate method for its assessment. Remote sensing has become an attractive alternative for the accomplishment of forest inventory, facilitating urban flora mapping. The present study aimed to identify the main species of trees in Teresina, Piauí, and evaluate the botanical identification accuracy by using high-resolution satellite images (Worldview-2) as compared to on-site inventory. We used the e-Cognition 8.7 software for the mapping, segmentation, and classification of the vegetal species and ERDAS Imagine 9.2 for accuracy verification. The NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) was used to analyze the natural vegetation condition. The outskirts of the city presented higher values of NDVI. An amount of 1,392 individuals from 53 species and 28 families, were identified. Among these, the families Anacardiaceae (20.7%), Fabaceae (19.8%), Meliaceae (9.4%), Myrtaceae (6.9%), Arecaceae (6.1%), and Combretaceae (5.5%) were the most prevalent. Amongst the 53 species identified, the 16 most abundant were chosen for the analysis. The classification had a satisfactory result for the 16 vegetal species with a general classification accuracy of 69.43% and a kappa agreement index of 0,68. The species that obtained the highest accuracy were Ficus benjamin (87,5%), Terminalia cattapa (83,3%), Syzygium malaccense (82,4%), Mangifera indica (76,8%), Caesalpinia ferrea (75,9%), Pachira aquatica (73,9%), and Tabebuia sp (75,9%). The results showed that it is feasible, although challenging, to classify biodiverse vegetation in an urban environment using high-resolution satellite images.

	abstract = {In the countries of the European Union, great importance is attached to urban trees, especially to indoor and outdoor treelines, parks and forests. They are considered both an object of the living world, a landscape element, and at the same time a tool against environment harms. Nowadays, 29.1% of the member states' population lives in rural areas, 39.3% in cities and 31.6% in towns and suburbs. Spreading constructions, extreme weather, rising summer temperatures, and urban heat islands have increased the value of urban green spaces, especially trees that provide shade and reduce air dryness. More and more cities are beginning to realize that urban trees are a value that they must take seriously, which have a positive amortization that is incomprehensible to an average accountant. In Hungary, local governments are required by law to manage their property responsibly, which means that the locality must have a tree inventory. The improvement of the situation is facilitated by the fact that more and more municipalities do regard green areas as infrastructure. In the beginning of our long term research, we examine the status of the partial tree inventories of two settlements with urban status in Hungary: Miskolc and Szeged. We hope that the ongoing research will enable us to get a comprehensive picture of the currently used inventory forms and data recording methods, with which we can ease the situation of municipalities that do not yet have a wood register. © 2023 IEEE.},

In the present study the aboveground biomass and C pools were estimated at the first section of the Chapultepec Park and its relationship with the basal area and species composition was analyzed. Carbon stock of this green area is expected to be important, at least with respect to local neighborhood’s emissions of CO2. For Fraxinus uhdei, the dominant species, biomass estimates generated in natural and urban equations were compared with those obtained in seven trees sampled at the site; the urban equation produced the best estimates. Based on inventories of 27.3% of the green areas of the first section and the use of allometric relationships, the total reservoir was estimated at 24 217 Mg of biomass and 11 226 Mg of C. The species composition and basal area significantly influenced biomass and C pools. The average C content was relatively high compared with those indicated in urban forests in other cities in the world, thus Chapultepec Park can be considered an important reservoir. © 2018, Instituto de Ecologia, A.C.

	abstract = {Vegetation has gained importance in respective debates about climate change mitigation and adaptation in cities. Although recently developed remote sensing techniques provide necessary city-wide information, a sufficient and consistent city-wide information of relevant urban ecosystem services, such as carbon emissions offset, does not exist. This study uses city-wide, high-resolution, and remotely sensed data to derive individual tree species information and to estimate the above-ground carbon storage of urban forests in Berlin, Germany. The variance of tree biomass was estimated using allometric equations that contained different levels of detail regarding the tree species found in this study of 700 km2, which had a tree canopy of 213 km2. The average tree density was 65 trees/ha per unit of tree cover and a range from 10 to 40 trees/ha for densely urban land cover. City-wide estimates of the above-ground carbon storage ranged between 6.34 and 7.69 tC/ha per unit of land cover, depending on the level of tree species information used. Equations that did not use individually localized tree species information undervalued the total amount of urban forest carbon storage by up to 15 %. Equations using a generalized estimate of dominant tree species information provided rather precise city-wide carbon estimates. Concerning differences within a densely built area per unit of land cover approaches using individually localized tree species information prevented underestimation of mid-range carbon density areas (10–20 tC/ha), which were actually up to 8.4 % higher, and prevented overestimation of very low carbon density areas (0–5 tC/ha), which were actually up to 11.4 % lower. Park-like areas showed 10 to 30 tC/ha, whereas land cover of very high carbon density (40–80 tC/ha) mostly consisted of mixed peri-urban forest stands. Thus, this approach, which uses widely accessible and remotely sensed data, can help to improve the consistency of forest carbon estimates in cities. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Technologies like Google Street View™ are appealing because they are free and easy to use. We used Street View to conduct a virtual survey of street trees in three municipalities, and compared our results to existing field data from the same locations. The virtual survey analyst recorded the locations of street trees, identified trees to the species level, and estimated diameter at breast height. Over 93% of the 597 trees documented in the field survey were also observed in the virtual survey. Tree identification in the virtual survey agreed with the field data for 90% of trees at the genus level and 66% of trees at the species level. Identification was less reliable for small trees, rare taxa, and for trees with multiple species in the same genus. In general, tree diameter was underestimated in the virtual survey, but estimates improved as the analyst became more experienced. This study is the first to report on manual interpretation of street tree characteristics using Street View. Our results suggest that virtual surveys in Street View may be suitable for generating some types of street tree data or updating existing data sets more efficiently than field surveys. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH},

Demand was uniformly spread across genetic families, as only Aceraceae (17.2%) was requested more than 9% of the time.},

	abstract = {Urban trees provide multiple benefits in the form of services to citizens, and urban forests are generally managed in order to maximize those benefits. However, urban environments feature harsh growing conditions for trees, and rapid climate change is now compounding existing stresses. In some cases, the habitat range of tree species is expected to shrink or to shift. To alleviate tree maladaptation and sustain the provision of services, urban foresters could resort to assisted migration (also known as assisted colonization). Assisted migration is an adaptation strategy where species are deliberately relocated out of their historical range in anticipation of future climatic change. The ecological risks and uncertainties it entails, as well as the value-laden dimensions involved in this strategy, have altogether made it a highly debated issue. In order to know if assisted migration is being considered as a management strategy, and to facilitate future policy and decision making, we conducted in-depth interviews with 18 urban foresters from southern Ontario about their practices and perspectives towards assisted migration. We found that although they are generally favourable to a constrained implementation of assisted migration, it is not part of their ongoing management strategies. Opinions are divided on the current need for assisted migration as well as the prevalence of the risks and uncertainties involved. However, respondents agree that trials and experiments need to be undertaken, along with tree inventories and monitoring, but so far efforts are few and scattered across municipalities and actors. Implementing assisted migration will require community involvement, knowledge sharing, leadership from higher levels of government, and coordinated efforts at multiple scales. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH.},

	abstract = {Expansion of urban fabric on carbon storages is estimated to cause loss of 1.38 Pg of Above-Ground Carbon (AGC) in pan-tropics between 2000 and 2030. This would be approximately 5% of all emissions caused by tropical land use changes. Despite the significance of the phenomenon, these emissions are rarely measured, monitored, or addressed in climate change mitigation plans, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, we demonstrated a state-of-the-art approach predicting AGC loss of Zanzibar City Region under multiple alternative urban planning scenarios between 2013 and 2030. The AGC information was modeled based on field measured forest inventory sample plots and RapidEye satellite data from 2013, while the future urban expansion model was calibrated with data of happened expansion between 2004, 2009 and 2013, and geospatial independent variables influencing the expansion patterns. This model was then projected until 2030, while alternative urban planning scenarios were integrated to the model by modifying the geospatial variables. The combination of these two models indicates that 42,000 Mg or 15% of total AGC in Zanzibar City Region can be anticipated to be lost by 2030 due to urban expansion. Majority of the loss will take place in the agroforest and fruit tree plantations surrounding the city, while natural forest face limited impacts. None of the tested alternative urban planning scenarios significantly impact the loss of AGC compared to the business-as-usual scenario. Therefore, alternative policies and plans are seriously needed to address the issue in Zanzibar. These could include promoting urban densification, directing urban expansion to low carbon areas, improving soil carbon management, and preparing an urban forestry and greenery strategy. All in all, the study indicates that data and methods are available for monitoring and predicting the phenomenon in Sub-Saharan Africa. Research based on a comparable methodology should be produced from all the main cities in the region that are surrounded by significant carbon storages and facing high urban expansion rates to support climate change mitigation. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {The spatiotemporal distribution pattern of the surface temperatures of urban forest canopies (STUFC) is influenced by many environmental factors, and the identification of interactions between these factors can improve simulations and predictions of spatial patterns of urban cool islands. This quantitative research uses an integrated method that combines remote sensing, ground surveys, and spatial statistical models to elucidate the mechanisms that influence the STUFC and considers the interaction of multiple environmental factors. This case study uses Jinjiang, China as a representative of a city experiencing rapid urbanization. We build up a multisource database (forest inventory, digital elevation models, population, and remote sensing imagery) on a uniform coordinate system to support research into the interactions that influence the STUFC. Landsat-5/8 Thermal Mapper images and meteorological data were used to retrieve the temporal and spatial distributions of land surface temperature. Ground observations, which included the forest management planning inventory and population density data, provided the factors that determine the STUFC spatial distribution on an urban scale. The use of a spatial statistical model (GeogDetector model) reveals the interaction mechanisms of STUFC. Although different environmental factors exert different influences on STUFC, in two periods with different hot spots and cold spots, the patch area and dominant tree species proved to be the main factors contributing to STUFC. The interaction between multiple environmental factors increased the STUFC, both linearly and nonlinearly. Strong interactions tended to occur between elevation and dominant species and were prevalent in either hot or cold spots in different years. In conclusion, the combining of multidisciplinary methods (e.g., remote sensing images, ground observations, and spatial statistical models) helps reveal the mechanism of STUFC on an urban scale. © 2018 by the authors.},

We studied 15 gardens and one sensory path located in various regions in Poland.

The results showed that the solutions used were only partly adequate for the needs of selected users. We found neither tactile walking surface indicators (e.g., communication lines and terrain), spatial models, nor applications in mobile devices. However, these could be useful for all visitors. We confirmed that although problems with the use of forest tourist space are dependent on the type of disability, by implementing the idea of universal design for all elements of recreational infrastructure, forests may be accessible for all users. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Urban forests are recognized for the multiple benefits they provide to city-dwellers. However, climate change will affect tree species survival and persistence in urban ecosystems. Tree failures will cause economic losses and jeopardize the delivery of societal benefits. The impacts of climate change will depend on the species’ resilience and adaptive capacity, as well as management actions which may ameliorate some of the negative impacts. Here, we assessed the potential vulnerability of Australia's urban forests to climate extremes. Our results can be used for future urban planning aiming to incorporate species that are well-adapted to the hotter, drier climates expected with climate change. Summary Urban forests (UFs) are recognized for the multiple benefits they provide to city-dwellers. However, global climate change—particularly predicted increases in the frequency and intensity of heatwaves and drought—will affect tree species’ performance and survival in urban ecosystems. Here, we assessed species composition and potential vulnerability of UFs in 22 Australian significant urban areas (SUAs) to heat and/or moisture stress. We quantified species’ realized climatic niches across their known distribution, and assessed the extent to which baseline climate in the SUAs where a particular species is planted fell within its niche. We used three environmental variables to group species based on their potential climate vulnerability. UFs varied in species composition and climate vulnerability across the continent. In general, neither climate similarity nor geographical proximity were good predictors of species composition among UFs. Of 1,342 tree species assessed (68.4% natives), 53% were considered potentially vulnerable to heat and/or moisture stress in at least one city where they are currently planted. Our results highlight the climate vulnerability of current plantings across Australian SUAs and can be used to direct future species selection that considers the species’ climate of origin and climatic niche. UF planning can incorporate species from SUAs with similar climates and with low vulnerability to contemporary, as well as future climate conditions. Species with high climate vulnerability, in contrast, may require more intensive management to avoid failure under future hotter, drier climate conditions. © 2019 The Authors.

Our work showed that the Plant.Id application gave the best performance by correctly identifying plants in the city of Prato with a median accuracy of 0.73 and better performance for the most common plants: Pinus pinea 0.87, Tilia aeuropea 0.87, Platanus hybrida 0.89. The proposed method also has a limitation. Trees within parks, walking paths and private green areas cannot be photographed and identified because Google cars cannot access them. The solution to this limitation is to combine GSV images with spherical photos taken via light unmanned aircraft. © 2023 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Spatial information on urban forest canopy height (FCH) is fundamental for urban forest monitoring and assisting urban planning and management. Traditionally, ground-based canopy height measurements are time-consuming and laborious, making it challenging for periodic inventory of urban FCH at crown level. Airborne-light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor can efficiently measure crown-level FCH; however, the high cost of airborne-LiDAR data collection over large scales hinders its wide applications at a high temporal resolution. Previous studies have shown that in some cases, the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP) approach (i.e., UAV-based structure from motion algorithm) is equivalent to or even outperform airborne-LiDAR in measuring forest structure, but few studies have evaluated their performances in measuring FCH in more complex urban environment, across non-ground coverage (including both canopy and building coverage) and topographical slope gradients. Also, the contribution of multi-angle measurement technique from UAV-DAP to FCH estimation accuracy has rarely been explored in the urban environment. Here, we compared the performances of UAV-LiDAR and UAV-DAP approaches on measuring thousands of crown-level FCH at different non-ground coverage and topographical slope areas in an urban environment. Specifically, UAV-LiDAR-based spatial measurements of crown-level FCH were used as the reference after ground-based validation (R2 = 0.88, RMSE = 2.36 m). The accuracy of UAV-DAP approach with/without multi-angle measurement in different non-ground coverage and topographical slope areas were then analyzed. The results showed that although the DAP multi-angle-based approach can improve the accuracy of spatial measurement for crown-level FCH in some cases, non-ground coverage (including both canopy and building coverage) was still the main factor affecting the broad applications of DAP approach in measuring urban FCH: at areas where non-ground coverage < 0.95, no matter how topographical slope varied, the accuracy of DAP approach was high (R2 = 0.86∼0.94, RMSE = 1.56∼2.93 m); at areas where non-ground coverage > 0.95, except for the case of flat areas (i.e., topographical slope <= 2°), the accuracy of DAP was poor (R2 = 0.20, RMSE = 12.34 m). However, using LiDAR-digital terrain model (DTM) instead of DAP-DTM, at areas where non-ground coverage > 0.95, can significantly improve the accuracy of UAV-DAP approach in measuring crown-level FCH (R2 = 0.91, RMSE =1.61 m). Our study thus provides a complete guidance on the usage of cost-effective UAV-DAP approach for measuring crown-level FCH in the urban environment, which will be helpful for precise urban forest management and improving the efficiency of urban environmental planning. © 2022 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {The urban area is a source of invasive plants that enter through human activities such as agriculture and land-use conversion. Studying the invasive plant in urban areas is essential to understanding the city’s ecosystem health condition. Therefore, this study aims to inventory invasive plants, map their distribution, and explain the relationship between land use with the community diversity and species richness of invasive plants in Bandung. The vegetation analysis was performed using line-transect in 22 study sites distributed using a systematic random sampling method in Bandung to observe the plant species composition. The study plots were placed based on the land-use type. The species name, individual number, frequency, and sampling site locations were noted and analyzed to calculate the important value index (IVI) and the invasive species distribution pattern using the principal component analysis (PCA). The dominant invasive species was spatially mapped. Six types of land use were used in this study, i.e., settlements, street green lanes, gardens, paddy fields, urban parks, and urban forests. There were 187 species found in Bandung, which can be categorized into alien invasive species (39%), invasive native plants (25%), non-invasive alien species (18%), non-invasive native species (15%), and unidentified plants (3%). The most common invasive plants found were Eleusine indica (IVI=10.50%), Trimezia martinicensis (IVI=7.22%), and Cyperus rotundus (IVI=6.74%). Based on the plant community similarity index, the study area with the highest similarities were paddy fields with gardens (50.5%), settlements with road lanes (44.4%), urban parks with road lanes (26.2%), and urban forests with road lane (17.5%). PCA showed Swietenia macrophylla as the most common invasive plant found in urban forests, urban parks, and road lanes, with air humidity as the most influencing environmental factor. Trimezia martinicensis is the most common species in the settlement area affected by high air humidity. Bidens pilosa is an invasive plant commonly found on paddy fields, gardens, settlements, road lanes, and urban park edges. This species can easily and rapidly reproduce with a high survival rate. The many invasive plants found in Bandung must be managed to maintain the urban ecosystem’s health. © (2023). All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {There is no doubt that the NATURA 2000 network has been one of the most relevant tools for nature protection. However, the designated areas within the borders of large cities are subjected to many threats. Traffic noise takes on a very important role in this subject, posing the question of whether NATURA 2000 areas should be located in urban areas strongly affected by noise pollution. This particular topic was exposed and analysed at Bielański Forest NATURA 2000 (PLH140041), located in northern Warsaw, where changes in noise distribution for the years 2007–2017 were examined and described by two types of indicators (Lden and Lnight). The data sources used for the analysis were city road noise maps for 2007, 2012 and 2017. Additionally, sound intensity measurements were taken in two separate groups of hot-spots. The first of these comprised locations determined based on an inventory of avifauna; they represented different habitat types, and were characterized by the highest bird activity. The second group of hot-spots consisted of those designated along roads in order to identify the main sources of traffic noise. The obtained results confirmed the high noise-absorbing ability of the existing vegetation. The avifauna surveys covered 19 forest bird species. Five of them were considered to be the most valuable and rare elements of the local avifauna, whereas 14 appeared to be key species for the functioning of biocenosis and, at the same time, determine the uniqueness of the ecosystem. The study showed that the type of habitat rather than differences in noise levels determines the distribution and abundance of key species. Therefore, there is a necessity to focus on actions that guarantee the maintenance of the existing status in order to counteract habitat deterioration. The investigation confirmed the feasibility of creating these kinds of natural protected areas in large cities, despite their exposure to noise pollution. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Individual tree detection for urban forests in subtropical environments remains a great challenge due to the various types of forest structures, high canopy closures, and the mixture of evergreen and deciduous broadleaved trees. Existing treetop detection methods based on the canopy-height model (CHM) from UAV images cannot resolve commission errors in heterogeneous urban forests with multiple trunks or strong lateral branches. In this study, we improved the traditional local-maximum (LM) algorithm using a dual Gaussian filter, variable window size, and local normalized correlation coefficient (NCC). Specifically, we adapted a crown model of maximum/minimum tree-crown radii and an angle strategy to detect treetops. We then removed and merged the pending tree vertices. Our results showed that our improved LM algorithm had an average user accuracy (UA) of 87.3% (SD± 4.6), an average producer accuracy (PA) of 82.8% (SD± 4.1), and an overall accuracy of 93.3% (SD± 3.9) for sample plots with canopy closures less than 0.5. As for the sample plots with canopy closures from 0.5 to 1, the accuracies were 78.6% (SD± 31.5), 73.8% (SD± 10.3), and 68.1% (SD± 12.7), respectively. The tree-height estimation accuracy reached more than 0.96, with an average RMSE of 0.61 m. Our results show that the UAV-image-derived CHM can be used to accurately detect individual trees in mixed forests in subtropical cities like Shanghai, China, to provide vital tree-structure parameters for precise and sustainable forest management. © 2023 by the authors.},

An understanding of the ecosystem services contributed by these and future plantings would provide critical information to policy and program developers, and a comprehensive inventory would contribute to estimating the cumulative effects of these plantings. Trees used in these practices are not explicitly inventoried by the primary national forest resource inventory of the United States: the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program of the USDA Forest Service. The FIA program currently limits its inventories to trees in forests meeting specific size and density criteria, but the draft FIA Strategic Plan suggests the addition of an "other treed land inventory" (excluding urban forests). In this study, we use FIA data to estimate the agroforestry and other tree resources of the Midwest and document some obstacles to effective inventories of agroforestry practices. We compare our estimates of forestland area in the Midwest to those derived from MODIS (MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Vegetative Continuous Fields (VCF). The differences between these two estimates, particularly in sparsely forested states, support the idea that the expansion of the FIA program to an all-tree inventory would fill an important gap. We propose minor modifications to the inventory that would lead to an improved assessment of agroforestry and other tree resources and practices. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	abstract = {Background: The distribution of forest vegetation within urban environments is critically important as it influences urban environmental conditions and the energy exchange through the absorption of solar radiation and modulation of evapotranspiration. It also plays an important role filtering urban water systems and reducing storm water runoff. Methods: We investigate the capacity of ALS data to individually detect, map and characterize large (taller than 15 m) trees within the City of Vancouver. Large trees are critical for the function and character of Vancouver’s urban forest. We used an object-based approach for individual tree detection and segmentation to determine tree locations (position of the stem), to delineate the shape of the crowns and to categorize the latter either as coniferous or deciduous. Results: Results indicate a detection rate of 76.6% for trees > 15 m with a positioning error of 2.11 m (stem location). Extracted tree heights possessed a RMSE of 2.60 m and a bias of − 1.87 m, whereas crown diameter was derived with a RMSE of 3.85 m and a bias of − 2.06 m. Missed trees are principally a result of undetected treetops occurring in dense, overlapping canopies with more accurate detection and delineation of trees in open areas. Conclusion: By identifying key structural trees across Vancouver’s urban forests, we can better understand their role in providing ecosystem goods and services for city residents. © The Author(s). 2018.},

Areas with non-forest lands significantly threaten the health, function, and value of the remaining forest. This study describes the effects of fragmentation on diversity of forest in the city of Istanbul. We obtained inventory data from local forest management and silvicultural plans (2002-2007). The data were used to determine the spatial variation in forest structure and biodiversity across six urban forest fragments in Istanbul, Turkey. We calculated a core set of patch- and class-level metrics in order to predict forest basal area within sample plots. We tested a number of regression models and employed the best-fitted model to extrapolate forest diversity across the urban forest fragments. Results indicate consistent relationship between spatial and silvicultural variables, suggesting the impact of fragmentation on the forest structure and biodiversity in Istanbul. Species richness of green spaces in urban areas was higher when compared to that of peri-urban areas. The location and the sizes of urban forests were associated with difference in societal expectations from these areas. As a consequence of the expectations, there was a change in forest structure in Istanbul.

The objective of this study was to develop a low-cost alternative method for forest inventory measurements and characterization of forest structure using handheld LiDAR technology. Three-dimensional (3D) maps of trees were obtained using an iPad Pro with a LiDAR sensor. Freely-available software programs, including 3D Forest Software and CloudCompare software, were used to determine tree diameter at breast height (DBH) and distance between trees. The 3D point cloud data obtained from the iPad Pro LiDAR sensor was able to estimate tree DBH accurately, with a residual error of 2.4 cm in an urban forest stand and 1.9 cm in an actively managed experimental forest stand. Distances between trees also were accurately estimated, with mean residual errors of 0.21 m for urban forest, and 0.38 m for managed forest stand. This study demonstrates that it is possible to use a low-cost consumer tablet with a LiDAR sensor to accurately measure certain forest attributes, which could enable the crowdsourcing of urban and other forest tree DBH and density data because of its integration into existing Apple devices and ease of use. © 2021 by the authors.},

	abstract = {For low-income nations, a low-cost Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) offers an alternative to the traditional time-intensive forest survey that requires many resources. This study was conducted in the remnant forest with the dominant tree species, Dipterocarpus alatus Roxb., forming the upper canopy. Photogrammetry techniques with UAV images were used to obtain the Canopy Height Model (CHM). The results of tree height, individual tree detection, biomass, and carbon sequestration were compared between ground truthing and photogrammetry estimation. The large percentages of trees were automatically recognized. However, due to a closed forest canopy, some trees might have been left out from the actual count, leading to an undercounting of trees and an underestimation of the aboveground biomass (AGB). The photogrammetric dataset demonstrated a good tree height extraction accuracy and did not differ significantly from that determined by ground truthing (RMSE=2.59 m and 8.24%). The mean predicted height AGB from direct measurement was 24.76 tons ha-1, higher than those obtained from single-and multi-set photogrammetry, 5.41 and 17.99 tons ha-1, respectively. AGB and carbon sequestration estimated from photogrammetry were 72.66% of the ground truthing value. The accuracy of the photogrammetry results was acceptable and feasi ble for detecting individual tree heights, biomass, and carbon sequestration in the remnant forest. Overall, low-cost UAV could create a cost, time-efficient, and reasonably accurate local-scale forest inventory. © 2023, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {While often considered “open grown,” urban trees are often found in relatively close proximity to neighboring trees, buildings, and other elements of urban infrastructure. These spatial arrangements may provide wind protection during severe weather events such as hurricanes. Beyond this very local scale, urban tree abundance and condition are often influenced by the greater sociodemographic context of the neighborhood or community where they are found. In an effort to assess the impact of these external factors on wind firmness after Hurricane Irma impacted Florida in 2017, we revisited three urban areas that had previously been inventoried using sample plots prior to the storm. At each plot we assessed storm damage and characterized surrounding protective elements (i.e., buildings and other trees) using a combination of ground-based and aerial approaches. This was then paired with block group level sociodemographic data derived from the United States Census. Logistic regression results confirmed previous research, showing that partial and whole tree failure were significantly more likely with a larger stem diameter (p = 0.001) and perceived/previously documented lower wind firmness (p = 0.004). However, our results disagreed with previous studies linking species diversity and resilience, showing tree failure was significantly more likely with higher Shannon Diversity Index (p = 0.008). A comparative geographically weighted logistic regression model also found that the higher proportions of African American residents and Hispanic residents, and the median age of residents were significant predictors of less likely tree failure in 30 %, 36 %, and 20 % of plots, respectively. However, this evidence was weak, compared to that of tree- and plot-level effects. Despite being a key predictor of interest, we did not see any significant protective effect from neighboring trees or structures. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {Forest policy planning and broad-scale management is often based on forest inventory data in many countries. However, the importance of social aspects such as aesthetic and recreational values is increasing, especially in urban areas, and need to be considered in forestry practice. We conducted a forest visitor survey at selected National Forest Inventory (NFI) sample plots in order to test whether this would be a way of integrating the social dimension of forest with national forest inventories toward a more comprehensive forest monitoring instrument, focusing on forest recreation and aesthetics. Visitors were asked to rate the visual attractiveness of the NFI plot and the surrounding forest. Multi-level modeling combining both plot-related inventory data and visitor-related questionnaire data showed that perceived forest attractiveness is determined by both social and physical factors. We conclude that it is worth further developing this method with the aim of implementing forest visitor surveys at a subset of NFI plots during routine field assessments, and, thus, significantly improving monitoring of forest recreation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

The materials for the study were data from the repeated measurements of permanent inventory plots at the Experimental Forest District of the Russian State Agrarian University – Moscow Timiryazev Agricultural Academy and forest areas of the Moscow Region. The growth of stands of mean height in the permanent inventory plots doesn’t correspond to the scale of site class determination: first, the forest site index is upgraded, and then it is declined. The results of the analysis of growth and productivity of larch stands have shown that these trees can be recommended for use in urban landscaping, as they demonstrate high resistance to adverse effects.

	abstract = {Designation of protected areas has become one of the primary approaches to reducing biodiversity loss, with the number of new set-asides growing in the last decades largely from the addition of small protected areas to the global portfolio. Information on the effectiveness of protected areas to stave off species extinction is surprisingly scarce, with almost nothing known about the long-term fate of biodiversity in smaller protected temperate forests. Here we use an uncommonly complete biodiversity inventory of a small protected deciduous forest to evaluate its performance over a 40-year time span. We tracked bird compositional changes using a within-season repeat sampling protocol allowing us unusual accuracy in documenting species gains and losses through time. We found that nearly half the species found in the forest at the time of initial protection are now extirpated, and that yearly forest species composition is highly dynamic. Ground nesting and migratory species were more likely to be extirpated than were canopy breeders, cavity nesters, and year-round residents. Regional population declines explained differences in extirpation probability across species indicating that the study population, to some extent, mirrored larger regional dynamics. However, a substantial number of species declined in abundance within the forest while experiencing no regional declines, or even regional increases, in abundance. Our results reinforce that even with protected status, small forest fragments may not provide the conservation benefits that protection is meant to provide. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {In precision forestry, tree species identification is key to evaluating the role of forest ecosystems in the provision of ecosystem services, such as carbon sequestration and assessing their effects on climate regulation and climate change. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of tree species classification of urban forests using aerial-based HyMap hyperspectral imagery and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. First, we conducted an object-based image analysis (OBIA) to segment individual tree crowns present in LiDAR-derived Canopy Height Models (CHMs). Then, hyperspectral values for individual trees were extracted from HyMap data for band reduction through Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) transformation which allowed us to reduce the data to 20 significant bands out of 118 bands acquired. Finally, we compared several different classifications using Random Forest (RF) and Multi Class Classifier (MCC) methods. Seven tree species were classified using all 118 bands which resulted in 46.3% overall classification accuracy for RF versus 79.6% for MCC. Using only the 20 optimal bands extracted through MNF, both RF and MCC achieved an increase in overall accuracy to 87.0% and 88.9%, respectively. Thus, the MNF band selection process is a preferable approach for tree species classification when using hyperspectral data. Further, our work also suggests that RF is heavily disadvantaged by the high-dimensionality and noise present in hyperspectral data, while MCC is more robust when handling high-dimensional datasets with small sample sizes. Our overall results indicated that individual tree species identification in urban forests can be accomplished with the fusion of object-based LiDAR segmentation of crowns and hyperspectral characterization. © 2016 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Land use can cause significant impacts on ecosystems and natural resources. To assess these impacts using life cycle assessment (LCA) and ensure adequate decision-making, comprehensive national inventories of land occupation and transformation flows are required. Here, we aim at developing globally differentiated inventories of land use flows that can be used for primary use in life cycle impact assessment or national land planning. Methods: Using publicly available data and inventory techniques, national inventories for several land use classes were developed. All land use classes were covered with the highest retrievable level of disaggregation within urban, forestry, agriculture and other land use classes, thus differentiating 21 land use classes. For illustrating the application of this newly developed inventory, two different application settings relevant to life cycle impact assessment were considered: the calculation of global normalisation references for 11 land use impact indicators related to soil quality assessment (adopting the methods recommended by the EU Commission) and the determination of generic globally applicable characterisation factors (CFs) resulting from aggregation of country-level CFs for situations for use when land use location is unknown. Results and discussion: We built national inventories of 21 land occupation and 17 land transformation flows for 225 countries in the world for the reference year 2010. Cross-comparisons with existing inventories of narrower scopes attested its consistency. Detailed analyses of the calculated global normalisation references for the 11 land use impact categories showed different patterns across the land use impact indicators for each country, thus raising attention on key land use impacts specific to each country. Furthermore, the upscaling of country-level CFs to global generic CFs using the land use inventory revealed discrepancies with other alternative approaches using land use data at different resolutions. Conclusions: In this study, we made a first attempt at developing national inventories of land use flows with sufficient disaggregation level to enable the calculation of normalisation references and differentiated impacts. However, the findings also demonstrated the need to refine the consistency of the inventory, particularly in the combination of land cover and land use data, which should be harmonised in future studies, and to expand it with differentiated coverage of more land use flows relevant to impact assessment. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Since its introduction in the 1860s, gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.), has periodically defoliated large swaths of forest in the eastern United States. Prior research has suggested that the greatest costs and losses from these outbreaks accrue in residential areas, but these impacts have not been well quantified. We addressed this lacuna with a case study of Baltimore City. Using two urban tree inventories, we estimated potential costs and losses from a range of gypsy moth outbreak scenarios under different environmental and management conditions. We combined outbreak scenarios with urban forest data to model defoliation and mortality and based the costs and losses on the distribution of tree species in different size classes and land uses throughout Baltimore City. In each outbreak, we estimated the costs of public and private suppression, tree removal and replacement, and human medical treatment, as well as the losses associated with reduced pollution uptake, increased carbon emissions and foregone sequestration. Of the approximately 2.3. M trees in Baltimore City, a majority of the basal area was primary or secondary host for gypsy moth. Under the low outbreak scenario, with federal and state suppression efforts, total costs and losses were $5.540. M, much less than the $63.666. M estimated for the high outbreak scenario, in which the local public and private sectors were responsible for substantially greater tree removal and replacement costs. The framework that we created can be used to estimate the impacts of other non-native pests in urban environments. © 2014 Elsevier GmbH.},

	abstract = {Street trees play an important role in the city, but large-scale, multi-city inventory data are very limited to date, which can help to define geo-climatic and social development influences on urban forest characteristics. In this paper we speculate that at national level, geocliamtes and street development shape the different street tree characteristics, and large scale street View images (SVIs)-measurements favor the identification of factors responsible for the street tree variations in China. By collecting urban trees from 11 metropolises through SVIs method, an inventory of urban trees in China, including 201,942 trees at 9807 sites, was obtained from a latitude gradient from tropical 18oN to cold-temperate 45oN. Individual tree size-related growth status, tree-shrub-herb-related vertical structure, tree species identity, and street condition and street development (total 20 social development parameters) in the inventory is recorded. We analyzed trends and factors influencing street trees characteristics through latitudinal variation, distribution, linear regression, redundancy (RDA) ordination, and inter-city comparisons. The results showed that 1) with latitude increased, DBH and CPS linearly decreased, together with more highly dense forests (>100 trees/100 m street segment) observed. Latitude independence was in TH and forest vertical structural complexity. 2) All tree size data were in the log-normal distribution pattern when the two-parameter model was used and was best fitted by the Johnson distribution pattern when the >2-parameter model was used. 3) Tree growth status showed strong latitude dependency (R2 > 0.4, p < 0.05), with latitude increase accompanied by a higher percentage of trees with poor growth status (diebacks, dead trees, etc.). 4) The top abundant trees were Populus spp., Cinnamomum camphora, Salix spp., Platanus acerifolia, Ficus macrocarpa (5.5 %–14.6 %), and the arbor-shrub-herb three-layer structured forests took 52.3 % of total sites. With latitude rise, increasing abundance of Populus spp., Salix spp., elm, and pine but decreasing abundance of the unrecognizable tree groups were found (p < 0.05). 5) We also constructed a street tree comprehensive index based on their potential for providing services to citizen from the inventory data and found it was negatively related to latitudes. RDA ordination showed that geo-climatic conditions (49 %–61.5 %) and social developments (21.4 %–52.7 %) were almost equally responsible for tree size, growth status, and vertical structural variations, while road width (lane number of the street) was the most potent predictor (coefficient > 2.0 %, p < 0.01) for these variations. Our study can benefit the national-level management of urban forests and inventory-based various ecological service precise evaluation. © 2023},

This is presented by analyzing five different forest reserves in the southern Caucasus (Republic of Georgia) where calculation of net water balance over the period of a year was conducted. This provided an insight into the drought at the sites during the growing season. The data were thereafter compared with similar calculations for five different cities in Western Europe in order to see if there were any matches in drought stress between the cities and the forest reserves. To extend the analysis, conditions in the five cities were assessed for high density and low density areas, and for the current climate and a future climate scenario. The comparisons revealed some matches between conditions in the forest reserves and those in different scenarios/areas in the cities. A secondary aim was to identify specific ecotypes in the wild demonstrating great potential to handle growing conditions similar to those in urban environments based on inventories of woody plants in the forest reserves. A total of 44 woody species were found in the forest reserve systems with a random distribution throughout the five study sites. Based on the commitments presented above a preliminary screening can be done where future tree selection focus can be directed towards highly promising species and ecotypes, which would undoubtedly limit the time lag before proper plant material can be released. © 2019 International Society of Arboriculture},

Tree mortality studies are essential to understanding the temporal dynamism of urban forests, and in particular, it is critical to incorporate institutional records and human decision-making regarding tree removals. In this study, we investigated tree removals on a highly urbanized college campus in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (US) by analyzing field inventories and institutional records, and by considering firsthand accounts of the University Landscape Architect. The annual mortality rate was 4.3%, higher than typical for comparable studies, which we attribute to construction pressure and proactive management to promptly remove unhealthy trees and manage risk. Capital projects and other construction caused 48.5% of all removals, other human land use decisions caused 2.0%, and tree health decline and risk management collectively accounted for 48.7%. The number of removed trees exactly equaled the number of new trees, and the campus has high taxonomic diversity, reflecting the extensive oversight by university tree and landscape professionals regarding tree removal and planting decisions. This study demonstrates the value of mixed-methods and transdisciplinary research to understand how urban forests change over time. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Urban forests contribute to maintaining livability and increase the resilience of cities in the face of population growth and climate change. Information about the geographical distribution of individual trees is essential for the proper management of these systems. RGB high-resolution aerial images have emerged as a cheap and efficient source of data, although detecting and mapping single trees in an urban environment is a challenging task. Thus, we propose the evaluation of novel methods for single tree crown detection, as most of these methods have not been investigated in remote sensing applications. A total of 21 methods were investigated, including anchor-based (one and two-stage) and anchor-free state-of-the-art deep-learning methods. We used two orthoimages divided into 220 non-overlapping patches of 512 × 512 pixels with a ground sample distance (GSD) of 10 cm. The orthoimages were manually annotated, and 3382 single tree crowns were identified as the ground-truth. Our findings show that the anchor-free detectors achieved the best average performance with an AP50 of 0.686. We observed that the two-stage anchor-based and anchor-free methods showed better performance for this task, emphasizing the FSAF, Double Heads, CARAFE, ATSS, and FoveaBox models. RetinaNet, which is currently commonly applied in remote sensing, did not show satisfactory performance, and Faster R-CNN had lower results than the best methods but with no statistically significant difference. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the performance of novel deep-learning methods in remote sensing applications and could be used as an indicator of the most suitable methods in such applications. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Urban forest and urban trees are currently facing several challenges arising from a changing climate, complex inner-city environments and severe threats of pathogen and insect attacks. The latter have already had serious consequences for many cities, with outbreaks of diseases and pests causing large-scale tree losses that will take a long time to resolve. The pest species Asian longhorned beetle (Anoplophora glabripennis) and citrus longhorned beetle (A. chinensis) have large numbers of host species and genera and can hence be classified as one of the most serious future threats to the urban (and natural) tree landscape. The question is not whether these new threats will arrive in northern Europe, but rather when an infestation will occur and how well prepared are cities to deal with it. This study presents an up-to-date compilation of the urban tree population in 10 major Nordic cities, based on recent tree inventories, and investigates and discusses the effects of an outbreak of the two longhorned beetle species, based on information taken from a review of 35 papers presenting host-related data on these species. Evaluation of the data on host susceptibility to the two longhorned beetles revealed clear differences in tree losses between scenarios, with predicted tree losses of 15–98% in the different cities. © 2019, The Author(s).},

Studies using active data-LiDAR in particular-accounted for 80% of the total increase over the entire time period, those using passive data or fusion of passive and active data comprised relatively small proportions of the total increase (8% and 12%, respectively). Additionally, ITCD research has moved from incremental adaptations of algorithms developed for passive data sources to innovative approaches that take advantage of the novel characteristics of active datasets like LiDAR. These improvements make it possible to explore more complex forest conditions (e.g., closed hardwood forests, suburban/urban forests) rather than a single forest type although most published ITCD studies still focused on closed softwood (41%) or mixed forest (22%). Approximately one-third of studies applied individual tree level (30%) assessment, with only a quarter reporting more comprehensive multi-level assessment (23%). Almost one-third of studies (32%) that concentrated on forest parameter estimation based on ITCD results had no ITCD-specific evaluation. Comparison of methods continues to be complicated by both choice of reference data and assessment metric; it is imperative to establish a standardized two-level assessment framework to evaluate and compare ITCD algorithms in order to provide specific recommendations about suitable applications of particular algorithms. However, the evolution of active remotely sensed data and novel platforms implies that automated ITCD will continue to be a promising technology and an attractive research topic for both the forestry and remote sensing communities. © 2016 by the authors.},

The region's heterogeneous vegetation cover cannot be modeled accurately with low-resolution (e.g., 1-km) land cover and vegetation information. Instead, local vegetation data are used in conjunction with multispectral satellite data to generate a detailed vegetation-based land-cover database of the region. A high-resolution emissions inventory is assembled by associating the vegetation data with appropriate emissions factors. The inventory reveals a substantial variation in BVOC emissions across the region, resulting from the region's diversity of both native and exotic vegetation. The importance of BVOC emissions from forest lands, desert lands, and the urban forest changes according to regional, metropolitan, and urban scales.

We then test this tool for forest inventory application in urban heterogeneous forests. The methodology was based on a voxel data structure derived from TLS PCD. We retrieved biophysical tree parameters including diameter at breast height (DBH), tree height, basal area, and volume. Our results showed that TLS-based metrics explained 91.17% (RMSE = 9.1739 cm, p < 0.001) of the variation in DBH at individual tree level. Though the scanner generated a high-density PCD, only 57.27% (RMSE = 0.7543 m, p < 0.001) accuracy was achieved for predicting tree heights in these very heterogeneous stands. Furthermore, we developed a voxel-based TLS volume estimation method. Our results showed that PCD generated from TLS single location scans only captures 18% of the total tree volume due to an occlusion effect; yet there are significant relationships between the TLS data and field measured parameters for DBH and height, giving promise to the utility of a side scanning approach. Using our method, aterrestrial LiDAR-based inventory, also applicable to mobile- or vehicle-based laserscanning (MLS or VLS), was produced for future calibration of Aerial Laser Scanning (ALS) data and urban forest canopy assessments. © 2012 by the authors.},

Earlier studies using high resolution satellite images have shown that automatic tree detection in urban areas using traditional classification techniques remains a very difficult task. This is mainly due to intra-crown spectral variation, heterogeneity of tree species and the complex spatial arrangement of individual trees with respect to other vegetated surfaces and elements of the urban space. This study aims to develop a reproducible object based image analysis (OBIA) methodology to locate and delineate individual tree crowns in urban areas using high resolution imagery and existing topographic maps. We propose an OBIA approach that considers the spectral, spatial and contextual characteristics of tree objects in the urban space. The classification strategy is implemented with classification rules that exploit object features at multiple segmentation levels such as spectral response, texture, size, geometry, roundness, and distance to shadow, which are used to modify the labeling and shape of image objects. The classification procedure was tested in a QuickBird image acquired over a city in The Netherlands with results indicating an identification rate of 75% for individual trees and a commission rate of 39%. For the group of trees the identification rate was 100%. We equally report on the geometrical and positional accuracy of the identified tree crown objects.},

	abstract = {The Parque Nacional da Tijuca in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is considered to be one of the world’s largest urban forests, however no systematic inventory of its herpetofauna is available. In the present study, we surveyed the amphibians and reptiles of this park to assess its species composition (including secondary data) and obtain estimates of species richness and abundance. We conducted active searches (460 hours) between January 2013 and December 2015. We identified the taxa endemic to either the Atlantic Forest or Rio de Janeiro state, and verified the conservation status of each species in the international, Brazilian, and state red lists. We also estimated the species richness and sampling sufficiency by rarefaction curves and Bootstrap richness estimator, and analyzed the distribution of the species abundance in Whittaker plots. We recorded 3,288 individuals over 36 months, representing 24 species of amphibians and 25 reptiles. The cumulative species curves, rarefaction, and the richness estimated indicated that sampling effort was adequate. Species abundance adjusted to the log-series model in both amphibians and reptiles. The four most abundant amphibians represented 70% of the individuals recorded in this group, while the two most abundant reptiles represented 60% of the total individuals. The inclusion of the secondary data raised the number of amphibian species to 38, and the number of reptiles to 36. Approximately 80% of the amphibian species and 28% of the reptile species recorded are endemic to the Atlantic Forest, and six of the amphibian species are endemic to Rio de Janeiro state. Six amphibian species and one reptile species are classified under some threat of extinction, and two reptile species were exotic. The considerable diversity of the herpetofauna of the Parque Nacional da Tijuca, which includes endemic and threatened species, reflects the effectiveness of the reforestation of this protected area and emphasizes the importance of its conservation. © 2021, Universidade Estadual de Campinas UNICAMP.

We attribute these findings to legacy effects of the separation of the city in the Cold War, when two different political, social and cultural systems of the 20th century led to different demands concerning fruit trees.

	abstract = {Mobile laser scanning (MLS) measurement technology is well-suited for individual-tree-based urban forest inventory because it can capture a dense three-dimensional (3D) point cloud from vertical structures of roadside trees in a rapid and cost-effective way. Street tree segmentation from MLS data is a preliminary and essential step for further extraction and analysis of tree attributes and is also a challenging problem because of the complex street environment. The accuracy of current methods is limited by information loss introduced by voxelization and artificially designed detection and segmentation rules based on prior knowledge that more or less lack ability to distinguish between street trees and other urban objects. To address the above issues, a two-step strategy for street tree segmentation method from MLS data was proposed, which worked on points directly instead of a set of voxels generated by spatial partition and made use of tree crown and trunk detectors trained by supervised learning algorithm. First, 16 local statistical features, including width, depth, elevation, dimensionality, and density features, were extracted from the sphere domain of each point using the grid index. Then these features were fused and tree crown and trunk detectors were trained from labelled MLS data of street through Discrete AdaBoost algorithm. Second, based on frame projection of point-wise prediction results of tree crown and trunk detectors, individual trees were located and segmented by exploiting non-connectivity between adjacent trees and adjacency within single trees. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed method can obtain point-wise street tree segmentation from MLS data with high accuracy tree crown and trunk detection without tedious detection or segmentation rules. The error rates of crown detector on test set were less than 0.3% accompanied by over 99.33% recall rates and over 98.59% precision rates and the error rates of trunk detector on test set were less than 0.06% accompanied by over 92.44% recall rates and over 94.14% precision rates. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Rapid expansion of urban built-up areas since the 1950s has led to the Milan region becoming one of the major metropolitan areas of Europe. This has been accompanied by significant structural changes to urban and peri-urban landscapes and fragmentation of formerly contiguous green corridors by the distribution of new urban forms such as housing and transport infrastructure. The need to address the loss of green space was first recognised by policy-makers at the end of the 1970s and in due course, this has led to new policies and laws. These policies included the introduction of the Milan metropolitan parks approach that, nowadays, is represented by numerous urban forests that have become the backbone of green infrastructure (GI) creation and management. In the last decades, a total of 10 000 hectares of new forests and green systems have been created. Boscoincittà and Parco Nord Milano are the best known examples of this approach aimed to redevelop the neighbourhoods of some suburbs of Milan to create multifunctional green spaces (forests, grasslands, wetlands, river corridor, and allotment gardens) in lands previously industrial or uncultivated. The creation and management of urban forests has become the backbone of GI creation and management in the Metropolitan Area of Milan. In recent decades, trends of land use change have been characterised by a rapid decrease in natural and agricultural areas and an increase in artificial and urban structures. Although the phenomenon is growing rapidly in this area, there is evidence of an opposite social and environmental trend highlighting the importance of GI positively affecting urban quality of life. Recent policies and management plans are dealing with this evidence by turning their attention to expanding green areas and infrastructure. The purpose of our investigation is to revisit effective measures designed to increase the quality and quantity of UGI in the metropolitan region under study. To this end, we assessed land use changes and described the potentialities and impacts of policies on such phenomena. The study analyses the main elements of UGI in the Italian context within the framework of the European Union Life + project called Emonfur, a research programme involving, inter alia, the establishment of an Urban Forest inventory and impact analysis of ecosystem services in the Metropolitan Area of Milan. Our research has allowed us to determine the current status of key sites by monitoring the policy and planning decisions that resulted in their development. We believe that such an analysis can pave the way to understand future land-use dynamics not only in northern Italy but in other metropolitan territories as well. © 2016 Landscape Research Group Ltd.},

	abstract = {As a remote sensing technique, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have great potential in several fields, such as monitoring vegetation in an urban area at low altitudes at a reasonable cost. In this study,we assessed the potential of individual tree detection by the structure of the motion algorithm (SfM) based on UAV images and derived point cloud. Urban broadleaved forests (Fateh garden) were photographed in the spring of 2018 with different structures, a mixed uneven-aged dense stand (MUDS), a mixed uneven-aged sparse stand (MUSS), and a pure even-aged dense stand (PDEs). The results of using the local maxima algorithm for the different structures showed a detection accuracy rate of 0.90, 0.54, and 0.32 for PDES, MUDS, and MUSS, respectively. Based on the results, the accuracy of tree detection is affected by the height of the trees (individuals with a height of fewer than 5 meters were not detected), and the species (Poplar trees were detected better than other species), as well as the searching window size. The fixed tree window size of 3×3 was the best window size, and the fixed smoothing window size was variable for each site. Using mean and Gaussian filters did not noticeably affect the results. In general, our study showed that the canopy height model (CHM) from UAV can detect trees with very high accuracy in urban forests with homogenous even-aged structures, while in uneven-aged stands, the accuracy of tree detection is medium to low. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

This study provides an inventory of butterflies and observations of plants visited by adults in a small urban park, the Américo Renê Giannetti Municipal city park, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais State. We sampled an area of 18.2 ha from December 2006 to December 2007 with entomological net and traps baited with fermented fruits. We recorded 165 individuals belonging to 78 species, as follows: 46 spp. of Nymphalidae; 10 spp. of Hesperiidae, seven spp. of Lycaenidae, seven spp. of Pieridae, five spp. of Riodinidae; and three species of Papilionidae. Between the plants visited the more attractive was Lantana camara (Verbenaceae), a shrub with flowers of vibrant colors and common source of nectar and pollen. The butterflies recorded show the importance of maintenance of urban green areas, providing favorable conditions for the permanence of butterflies, even in anthropic environments.},

Such data makes it possible to identify changes in forest stands under the influence of recreationists, environmental pollution, and climate change. Long-term observational data are particularly valuable in modeling forest stand growth and productivity. The goal of the study is to develop a dynamic model of the growth of oak stands in Moscow based on long-term observation data. The modelling data were obtained from 7 plots of the permanent sample plot network established by the Forest Experimental Station of the Russian State Agrarian University - Moscow Timiryazev Agricultural Academy. There are a total of 42 inventories and the number of inventories per plot range from 3 to 9. Inventories were carried out between 1927 and 2009. We used three initial state variables for prediction, as in many studies. Taking into account the peculiarities of the inventory of forest stands in Russia, the mean height, quadratic mean diameter and number of trees per hectare were used as initial variables. All obtained models meet the requirements for forest inventory in Russia in terms of error values of stand attributes. The model in this study provides a simple and reliable system for predicting the growth and yield of Moscow oak stands. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

Applying digital imaging in forest inventory is an efficient way to decrease the workload. In this study, spherical images taken using a novel commercial 360° camera (Ricoh Theta S) and stereographic geometry were applied to obtain these parameters directly without stitching multiple images from common cameras. This technology was validated in both a sparse urban forest (pairwise comparison) and denser real forest (distributional comparison) in Atlantic Canada. The DBH (r2 > 0.76) and height (Dmax < 0.25, K-S test) showed high correspondence with field measures. The spherical camera represents a low-cost option to terrestrial laser scanning and has potential to produce more accurate forest-level estimates with quicker field and office processing time than current under-canopy remote sensing technologies. © 2020.

	abstract = {Urban forest biomass is a major store of carbon and thus plays an important role in the regional and global carbon cycle. In this paper, the estimating method of urban forest biomass based on the field inventory data, remote sensing data and spatial analysis was explored. The spatiotemporal dynamics of urban forest biomass in Shanghai, China between 2005 and 2012 were analyzed. The results show that (1) The density and amount of forest biomass in Shanghai maintained a steady increase between 2005 and 2012. The mean biomass density across Shanghai increased from 34.82 tlha in 2005 to 37.12 tlha in 201 2,and the amount raised from 3.02 m illion tons (Tg) in 2005 and 3. 14Tg in 2008 to 3.42Tg in 2012. Of which, the forest biomass increased annually by 0.04 Tg from 2005 to 2008 and 0.07 Tg from 2008 to 2012. The mostly fraction (94 %) of total forest biomass was in the suburban areas and only 6% in the urban areas, which were in accordance with their area proportions to the total Shanghai area ,that was respectively 95.44'Yoand 4.56%. (2) The higher forest biomass density areas concentrated mostly in the urban areas such as the northern Pudong New District and Huangpu District, where there are higher tree planting density , mature trees and elder forests. S uburban districts such as Qingpu District and Jiading District presented the lower forest biomass density, because the landuse types in these areas consisted mainly of industrial and agricultural land and forests are mostly younger managed. The spatial distribution of forest biomass displayed a tendency of high density in northeast area and low in southwest area.(3) The total forest biomass and average biomass density in the urban and suburban areas presented different change traces over the past two periods of 2005-2008 and 2008-2012. in the urban areas , the total biomass and average biomass density decreased slightly from 2005 to 2008, and increased gradually from 2008 to 2012, whereas the associated value both rose continuously in the suburban areas between 2005 and 2012. This dynamics tendency showed a consistency with the forest change. it was concluded that the urban forest biomass keeps rising stably and modified constantly in the spatial distribution as well with the rapid development of economy and modernization in Shanghai. More emphasis on the harmonious development of economy, social and ecology should be put to make great support to comprehend the regional and global carbon cycle. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Purpose This study provides a detailed, process-based life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory of an ornamental tree production system for urban forestry. The success of large-scale tree planting initiatives for climate protection depends on projects being net sinks for CO2 over their entire life cycle. However, previous assessments of urban tree planting initiatives have not accounted for the inputs required for tree production in nurseries, which include greenhouse systems, irrigation, and fertilization. A GHG inventory of nursery operations for tree production is a necessary step to assess the life cycle benefits or drawbacks of large-scale tree planting activities. Methods Using surveys, interviews, and life cycle inventory databases, we developed a process-based life cycle inventory of GHG emissions for a large nursery operation in California, USA. Results and discussion The inventory demonstrated that 4.6 kg of CO2-equivalent is emitted per #5 (nominally a 5- gallon) tree, a common tree size produced by nurseries. Energy use contributed 44% of all CO2-equivalent emissions, of which electricity and propane constituted 78%. Electricity use is dominated by irrigation demands, and propane is used primarily for greenhouse heating. Material inputs constituted the next largest contributor at 36% of emissions; plastic containers contributed just over half of these emissions. Transport emissions accounted for 16% of total nursery GHG emissions. Shipping bamboo stakes from China (43%) and diesel fuel consumed by nursery delivery trucks (33%) were the largest transport emission sources. Conclusions GHG emissions from the tree production life stage are 20% to 50% of mean annual CO2 storage rates based on urban tree inventories for three California cities. While considering nursery production alone is insufficient for drawing conclusions about the net climate change benefits of tree planting initiatives, the results demonstrate that nursery production emissions are modest compared with CO2 storage rates during tree life. Identifying key sources of emissions in the nursery tree production system can help operators reduce emissions by targeting so-called hot-spots. In particular, switching to renewable energy sources, capitalizing on energy and water efficiency opportunities, container light-weighting, and sourcing bamboo stakes from producers closer to the point of use are potential avenues for reduced emissions. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

The aim of this paper was to determine the dendrological and dasometric characteristics of the stands at the 2nd section of Chapultepec Forest, according with the information obtained from a total tree inventory, complemented with 111 sampling sites of 500 m2. The estimated mean of trees per site was 295/ha, the mean crown cover value was 27,19 m2 and the canopy cover in the area exceeds 80% of the total surface. The mean basal area was 0,10 m2 and the stems occupied 0,32% of the total surface. This data will provide basic indicators for the 2nd section tree stands and a reference for future research projects and characterization of UGA in the city. In addition, the information is basic to sustain the management that requires the urban forest of Mexico City.},

	abstract = {Local governments have created regulations aimed to maintain and increase valuable urban tree cover. The City of Falls Church, Virginia, U S A, requires each residential redevelopment to retain or plant enough trees for 20% canopy cover within ten years. To assess whether this goal is being met, we studied 21 Falls Church residential lots redeveloped between 1994 and 2011 where existing houses had been replaced with larger ones. Initial tree inventories and measurements prior to redevelopment were recorded in redevelopment plans. We remeasured preserved and planted trees in a ground survey and modeled tree canopy growth from a periodic tree diameter growth model linked to a model relating tree and crown diameters. Geospatial analysis was used to calculate nonoverlapping canopy cover within lots from crown diameter measurements and/or model predictions. We found that the City of Falls Church generally met its 20% canopy cover goal, but that the canopy cover metric alone is insufficient to fully describe urban forest recovery. Although canopy cover might recover rapidly from planting many small trees, recovery to the larger tree sizes that maximize ecosystem services can take much longer. Our modeling of lot-scale growth from field measurements showed the potential to manage forests using traditional diameter-based forest metrics that would relate results to canopy cover when needed. These forest stand metrics—based on basal area and trees per hectare—can account for tree size changes masked by the canopy cover metric. ©2020 International Society of Arboriculture.},

	abstract = {Remote Sensing (RS) techniques are increasingly used in urban tree inventory measurements for their improved accuracy and promptness over the conventional methods. The focus of this study is to evaluate the application of iPad Pro 2020 and its LiDAR sensor for urban trees reconstruction and Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) measurements. Altogether, 101 trees were scanned. We have used individual- and multiple-tree scan modes with different settings (Resolution: 10 mm, 15 mm, 20 mm; Confidence: High, Low). With these methods and settings, we have established 12 combinations. The 3DScannerAPP was used to scan and generate point clouds and to estimate DBH circle-fitting algorithm was used within the DendroCloud software. Among 12 methods, the only method with 10 mm resolution, high confidence, and multiple-tree mode has not achieved a 100% detection rate (97%). For multiple-tree mode, the highest estimation accuracy was 7.52% of relative RMSE, and for single-tree mode, it was 7.27%. Low confidence setting had significantly higher accuracy of DBH estimation than high confidence. Furthermore, single-tree mode had a significantly higher accuracy of DBH estimation than multiple-tree mode. The most efficient combination for DBH estimation of urban trees using 3DScannerAPP within iPad Pro 2020, when time and accuracy is considered, was multiple-tree mode with 15 mm resolution and low confidence. © 2021 X.

	abstract = {The condition of tree crowns is an important indicator of tree and forest health. Crown conditions have been evaluated during inventories of the US Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program since 1999. In this study, remeasured data from 55,013 trees on 2616 FIA plots in the eastern USA were used to assess the probability of survival among various tree species using the suite of FIA crown condition variables. Logistic regression procedures were employed to develop models for predicting tree survival. Results of the regression analyses indicated that crown dieback was the most important crown condition variable for predicting tree survival for all species combined and for many of the 15 individual species in the study. The logistic models were generally successful in representing recent tree mortality responses to multiyear infestations of beech bark disease and hemlock woolly adelgid. Although our models are only applicable to trees growing in a forest setting, the utility of models that predict impending tree mortality goes beyond forest inventory or traditional forestry growth and yield models and includes any application where managers need to assess tree health or predict tree mortality including urban forest, recreation, wildlife, and pest management. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland (outside the USA).},

	abstract = {Urban trees provide numerous benefits, such as cooling from transpiration, carbon sequestration, and street aesthetics. But volatile organic compound emissions from trees can combine with anthropogenic nitrogen oxide emissions to form ozone, a harmful air pollutant. The most commonly-emitted of these compounds, isoprene, negatively impacts air quality and hence is detrimental to human health. In addition to environmental controls such as light and temperature, the quantity of isoprene emitted from a leaf is a genus-specific trait. Leaf isoprene emission is enzymatically controlled, and species are typically classified as emitters or non-emitters (near-zero emission rates). Therefore, the species composition of urban forests affects whole-system isoprene production. The process of plant invasion alters species composition, and invasive tree species can be either emitters or non-emitters. If an invasive, isoprene-emitting tree species displaces native, non-emitting species, then isoprene emission rates from urban forests will increase, with a concomitant deterioration of air quality. We tested a hypothesis that invasive species have higher isoprene emission rates than native species. Using existing tree species inventory data for the Chicago region, leaf-level isoprene emission rates of the six most common invasive and native tree species were measured and compared. The difference was not statistically significant, but this could be due to the variability associated with making a sufficient number of measurements to quantify species isoprene emission rates. The most common invasive species European buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica, L.) was an emitter. Because European buckthorn often invades the disturbed edges common in urban forests, we tested a second hypothesis that edge-effect isoprene emissions would significantly increase whole-system modeled isoprene emissions. Using Google Earth satellite imagery to estimate forested area and edge length in the LaBagh Woods Forest Preserve of Cook County (Chicago, IL, USA), edge isoprene emission contributed 8.1% compared to conventionally modeled forest emissions. Our results show that the invasion of European buckthorn has increased isoprene emissions from urban forests. This implies that ecological restoration efforts to remove European buckthorn have the additional benefit of improving air quality. © Copyright © 2021 Mistry, Steffeck and Potosnak.},

	abstract = {Tree survival is a performance metric for urban forestry initiatives, and an understanding of the factors that influence mortality can help managers target resources and enhance survival. Furthermore, urban tree planting investments depend on tree survival to maximize ecosystem services. In this literature review, we categorized factors commonly associated with urban tree mortality and summarized mortality rates published in 56 studies, focusing on studies of trees along streets, in yards, and in landscaped parks. Study designs included quantitative field monitoring of uneven-aged tree populations and tracking planting cohorts of even-aged trees, as well as qualitative analyses. Annual mortality rates ranged from 0.6 to 68.5% for cohort studies and 0 to 30% for repeated inventories of uneven-aged trees. The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd quartiles of annual mortality were 2.8 to 3.8%, 4.4 to 6.5%, and 7.1 to 9.3% for planting cohorts, and 1.6%, 2.3 to 2.6%, and 3.0 to 3.3% for repeated inventories of uneven-aged trees (ranges reflect studies that reported a range for the time period or mortality rate). For cohort studies, annual mortality tended to be highest during the first five years after planting. The most commonly cited biophysical factors associated with mortality were taxa (15 articles), tree size/age (13 articles), and site characteristics (12 articles). The most commonly cited human-related factors were stewardship, maintenance, and vandalism (15 articles). More long-term studies are needed to investigate how site characteristics influence mortality, including rarely examined soil and microclimate characteristics. Future research should also examine institutional structures related to mortality outcomes, as well as parcel-level sociodemographic factors and resident behaviors. © 2019 International Society of Arboriculture},

There are several sampling methods available, and choices for urban tree inventory methods vary according to the place to be studied and the urban tree conditions. This study compared the results of simple and stratified random sampling methods with those of a total district tree census. The simple random sampling error was 17%, and the coefficient of variation was 47%. The stratified random sampling errors varied from 19% to 60%, and their coefficients of variation ranged from 32% to 70%, depending on the stratum. The Shannon diversity index (SDI) was low in the census (3.07), as in the simple random sampling (1.27). The total number of trees and the number of trees per kilometer of sidewalk calculated by the simple random sampling were similar to those obtained by the census. Because the sampling error obtained by stratified random sampling was higher than for that obtained by simple random sampling, the use of stratified random sampling was not advantageous when compared with simple random sampling. Furthermore, the stratified random sampling procedure was more complex. © 2005 International Society of Arboriculture.},

Acquiring accurate and up-to-date inventory information for street trees is required for urban horticultural planning, and municipal urban forest management. This paper presents a new Voxel-based Marked Neighborhood Searching (VMNS) method for efficiently identifying street trees and deriving their morphological parameters from Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) point cloud data. The VMNS method consists of six technical components: voxelization, calculating values of voxels, searching and marking neighborhoods, extracting potential trees, deriving morphological parameters, and eliminating pole-like objects other than trees. The method is validated and evaluated through two case studies. The evaluation results show that the completeness and correctness of our method for street tree detection are over 98%. The derived morphological parameters, including tree height, crown diameter, diameter at breast height (DBH), and crown base height (CBH), are in a good agreement with the field measurements. Our method provides an effective tool for extracting various morphologicalparameters for individual street trees from MLS point cloud data. © 2013 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Cities are taking the lead on climate change mitigation with ambitious goals to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The implementation of effective mitigation policies will require accurate measurements to guide policy decisions and monitor their efficacy. Here, we present a comprehensive CO2 inventory of an urban temperate forest and unmanaged grassland using field observations. We estimate the annual storage of CO2 by vegetation and soils and place our biogenic flux estimates in the context of local fossil fuel (FF) emissions to determine when, where, and by how much biogenic fluxes alter net CO2 flux dynamics. We compare our hourly estimates of biogenic fluxes in the forest site to modeled estimates using a modified version of Urban-Vegetation Photosynthesis and Respiration Model (Urban-VPRM) in Washington DC/Baltimore area presenting the first urban evaluation of this model. We estimate that vegetation results in a net biogenic uptake of −2.62 ± 1.9 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 in the forest site. FF emissions, however, drive patterns in the net flux resulting in the region being a net source of CO2 on daily and annual timescales. In the summer afternoons, however, the net flux is dominated by the uptake of CO2 by vegetation. The Urban-VPRM closely approximates hourly forest inventory based estimates of gross ecosystem exchange but overestimates ecosystem respiration in the dormant season by 40%. Our study highlights the importance of including seasonal dynamics in biogenic CO2 fluxes when planning and testing the efficacy of CO2 emission reduction polices and development of monitoring programs. © 2021.

	abstract = {Resilient cities incorporate a social, ecological, and technological systems perspective through their trees, both in urban and peri-urban forests and linear street trees, and help promote and understand the concept of ecosystem resilience. Urban tree inventories usually involve the collection of field data on the location, genus, species, crown shape and volume, diameter, height, and health status of these trees. In this work, we have developed a multi-stage methodology to update urban tree inventories in a fully automatic way, and we have applied it in the city of Pamplona (Spain). We have compared and combined two of the most common data sources for updating urban tree inventories: Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) point clouds combined with aerial orthophotographs, and street-level imagery from Google Street View (GSV). Depending on the data source, different methodologies were used to identify the trees. In the first stage, the use of individual tree detection techniques in ALS point clouds was compared with the detection of objects (trees) on street level images using computer vision (CV) techniques. In both cases, a high success rate or recall (number of true positive with respect to all detectable trees) was obtained, where between 85.07% and 86.42% of the trees were well-identified, although many false positives (FPs) or trees that did not exist or that had been confused with other objects were always identified. In order to reduce these errors or FPs, a second stage was designed, where FP debugging was performed through two methodologies: (a) based on the automatic checking of all possible trees with street level images, and (b) through a machine learning binary classification model trained with spectral data from orthophotographs. After this second stage, the recall decreased to about 75% (between 71.43 and 78.18 depending on the procedure used) but most of the false positives were eliminated. The results obtained with both data sources were robust and accurate. We can conclude that the results obtained with the different methodologies are very similar, where the main difference resides in the access to the starting information. While the use of street-level images only allows for the detection of trees growing in trafficable streets and is a source of information that is usually paid for, the use of ALS and aerial orthophotographs allows for the location of trees anywhere in the city, including public and private parks and gardens, and in many countries, these data are freely available. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Monetary valuation using urban tree appraisals can be performed with formulas, a common practice in many countries. This study compares twelve parametric type formulas: Amenity Valuation of Tree and Woodlands (Helliwell), Standard Tree Evaluation Method (STEM), French Method, Italian Method, Tedesco, Norma Granada, Trunk Replacement Formula (CTLA), Burnley Method, Danish Method, Swiss Method, and two Chilean formulas used in Municipalities of Concepción, La Pintana, and Maipú (COPIMA Method), and Peñalolén Method. Formulas were then applied to 30 trees located in Santiago, Talca and Concepción, Chile. Researchers used eight appraisers divided into two groups, according to senior-level and junior-level experience. Statistical differences were determined using the Kruskal-Wallis test of non-parametric variance, while Fisher's least significant difference test was used to identify homogeneous groups. The results show a wide dispersion of values that were high for "emblematic" trees and low for young or low-vigor trees. Formula, type of appraisers, and inter-appraiser differences formed nine, two, and three groups, respectively. The lowest-appraised trees were obtained using the Danish and French Method, while the highest values were obtained with the Burnley, Helliwell, and STEM formulas. Although there were differences in tree value according to the type of appraiser, when comparing difference among appraisers, researchers found these were not due to experience level. Given the wide range of values found, the study authors cannot recommend any specific formula(s) for assessing urban trees, as results will depend on the variables of interest used in the formulas and their intended application and use. © 2017 International Society of Arboriculture.},

The alignment of tree species composition with foraging practices in cities, and the provisioning services harvesters derive, in UGS remains less well studied. To address this gap, we draw on existing tree species data and forager practices in the City of Philadelphia to estimate the alignment between tree species composition and foraging in the city. Our approach uses an existing forest inventory, an international online database of useful species, online information for residents about useful species found in the city, and novel data about forager practices. By considering these datasets in tandem, we are able to identify useful tree species, species likely of interest to foragers, and species actively foraged, and estimate the relative abundance of species in each category. Our results suggest that managers may be able to analyze proxy data, through use of online quality ratings, to rapidly identify and assess forager interest in species found in their urban forests. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {We examined the spatial distribution, occurrence, and socioecological predictors of woody invasive plants (WIP) in two subtropical, coastal urban ecosystems: San Juan, Puerto Rico and Miami-Dade, United States. These two cities have similar climates and ecosystems typical of subtropical regions but differ in socioeconomics, topography, and urbanization processes. Using permanent plot data, available forest inventory protocols and statistical analyses of geographic and socioeconomic spatial predictors, we found that landscape level distribution and occurrence of WIPs was not clustered. We also characterized WIP composition and occurrence using logistic models, and found they were strongly related to the proportional area of residential land uses. However, the magnitude and trend of increase depended on median household income and grass cover. In San Juan, WIP occurrence was higher in areas of high residential cover when incomes were low or grass cover was low, whereas the opposite was true in Miami-Dade. Although Miami-Dade had greater invasive shrub cover and numbers of WIP species, San Juan had far greater invasive tree density, basal area and crown cover. This study provides an approach for incorporating field and available census data in geospatial distribution models of WIPs in cities throughout the globe. Findings indicate that identifying spatial predictors of WIPs depends on site-specific factors and the ecological scale of the predictor. Thus, mapping protocols and policies to eradicate urban WIPs should target indicators of a relevant scale specific to the area of interest for their improved and proactive management. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Street tree inventories are costly procedures that must be designed to optimally meet management and operational requirements. To assess the importance of several low-technology inventory parameters, a three-step multivariate statistical analysis was designed and tested on growth models of Norway maple (Acer platanoides), silver maple (Acer saccharinum), common hackberry (Celtis occidentalis), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), honeylocust (Gleditsia triacanthos), littleleaf linden (Tilia cordata), and Siberian elm (Ulmus pumila). The first step appraised and compared the significance of qualitative and quantitative parameters. Results revealed that using qualitative indices decreased the explanatory power of models. Accordingly, it was proposed that quantitative parameters be preferred for urban tree inventory. The second step aimed at reducing the volume of necessary information needed for urban tree growth estimation. Various simple and complex combinations of quantitative parameters were tested. Results were conclusive and species independent: the simplified models were statistically non-significant. The best model was composed of multiple parameters. The third step looked for the identifcation of an inventory parameter that could be used to assess any urban tree physiological stage. It was found that no single parameter can adequately delineate the complexity of all tree physiological stages. The optimal model is rather multidimensional. © 2009 international society of arboriculture.},

We established ten plots (20x 20m), where all trees with DBH ≥ 5 cm were sampled. The inventory included 605 trees (1513 ind.ha-1) distributed across 25 species. The diversity index (H' = 0.92) and basal area (10.43 m2.ha-1) were lower than in surrounding forests. The results showed a great dominance of Eremanthus erythropappus with consequent delay in successional advance, and low potential of attraction of fauna, which suggests the need for management to control its population.

	abstract = {Urban trees and urban forests play important roles in the ecology of human habitats and the wider environment. However, these roles may be undermined by the community and resulting decline in urban forest cover over time. This study analyses the value of trees and forests in improving the urban environment and assesses the awareness level of communities of the value of trees and forests in Hawassa City, Ethiopia. A cross-sectional survey design was applied and data were obtained from a structured questionnaire survey of 200 respondents and from twenty-two interviews with key stakeholders. The collected data were analysed using descriptive statistics, chi-square test, and multiple linear regression models. Educational level and an annual income of the residents had strongly significant (p = 0.000) association with the awareness level of residents of the value of urban trees and forest. About 99% of the respondents noted that trees and forest have shading and cooling effects, 93% perceived trees as for recreational value, and 88% of them stated that trees and forests are important for city beautification. The chi-square test showed that there is a significant difference between forest-related services users and non-users. Multiple regression models indicated that sex, age, annual income and education level were found statistically significant (p = 0.000) and positively affect respondents’ level of understanding about the value of urban trees and forest in improving the urban environment. Urban trees and forests have also played crucial roles, around reducing Urban Heat Island effect, improving shading and cooling services and reducing soil erosion, and this was statistically significant (p = 0.001). Lack of awareness on the use of urban trees and forest, limited public support for urban green infrastructure, poor policy and strategic guidance were found to be influential factors affecting the management of urban trees and forest. Rapid city-expansion has also contributed to lesser understanding and poor management practices of urban trees and forest. This implies that comprehensive inventories of urban trees and forest resources across the city should be conducted using geospatial technologies. Thus, systematic and integrated stakeholder involvement is crucial to address those issues at local, regional and national levels. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group and Arboricultural Association.},

We aim to evaluate the phytosanitary status of each tree, potential popular uses and damages caused by trees to the infrastructure. Data collection was based on inventoring the trees on streets and squares of the neighborhood. Trees were identified and classified based on plant health, spinning damage, pavement damage, origin of the species and social use. In total, we sampled 1,203 individuals belonging to 88 species and 32 families. The most abundant species were Pachira aquatica and Terminalia catappa. Fabaceae and Arecaceae were the most commonly cultivated plant families. In total, 67% of the recorded species and 83% of the individuals registered were exotic. Licania tomentosa was the most damaging species to electric wires. Licania tomentosa and Ficus benjamina were the most damaging species to pavement. We conclude that few trees species are damaging the infrastructure. From a biodiversity perspective, there are too many exotic species and a lack of native species, as urban afforestation has strong impact on natural ecosystems of the City. © 2021 Instituto de Pesquisas Jardim Botanico do Rio de Janeiro.

	abstract = {Trees provide important ecological services in cities, yet the vulnerability of the urban forest to massive tree losses from pest outbreaks could threaten those services, with unknown environmental consequences. The outbreak of emerald ash borer is an imminent threat to the ash population in North America. In the Minneapolis-Saint Paul, Minnesota, metropolitan area, ash trees are present in 50 % of residential landscapes in Ramsey and Anoka Counties. We used a large survey of household activities, a tree inventory, a Household Flux Calculator accounting tool, and a set of annual evapotranspiration measurements, to quantify the current carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus storage in ash trees, the cycling of these elements, and the total evapotranspiration from ash trees in residential areas in the metropolitan region. Ash represented 6 % of the trees in residential areas and the removal of the entire ash population would correspondingly reduce net primary production and carbon sequestration by only a few percent and would have negligible effects on losses of nitrogen and phosphorus from residential landscapes. Similarly, the effects of ash loss on the hydrologic cycle would be minimal and would depend largely on management choices for the ground currently underneath ash tree canopies. Overall, the percentage change in biogeochemical and hydrological fluxes corresponded closely with the percent of the total urban tree population that was represented by ash, suggesting that areas with higher densities of ash would experience correspondingly larger effects. A hypothetical tree replacement scenario with similar broadleaf species was determined to be likely to re-establish the original biogeochemical and hydrological conditions once the replacement trees reach maturity. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

	abstract = {Human exposure to green space and vegetation is widely recognized to result in physical and mental health benefits; however, to date, the specific effects of tree cover, diversity, and species composition on student academic performance have not been investigated. We compiled standardized performance scores in Grades 3 and 6 for the collective student body in 387 schools across the Toronto District School Board (TDSB), and examined variation in relation to tree cover, tree diversity, and tree species composition based on comprehensive inventories of trees on school properties combined with aerial-photo-based assessments of tree cover. Analyses accounted for variation due to socioeconomic factors using the learning opportunity index (LOI), a regional composite index of external challenges to learning that incorporates income and other factors, such as students with English as a second language. As expected, LOI had the greatest influence on student academic performance; however, the proportion of tree cover, as distinct from other types of “green space” such as grass, was found to be a significant positive predictor of student performance, accounting for 13% of the variance explained in a statistical model predicting mean student performance assessments. The effects of tree cover and species composition were most pronounced in schools that showed the highest level of external challenges, suggesting the importance of urban forestry investments in these schools. © 2018 Sivarajah et al.

	abstract = {Background and Purpose: In Zagreb, the forests have assumed the characteristics of forest parks, of which the most famous and the most visited is Maksimir Park. The health condition of many trees has deteriorated due to environmental changes and the forest's age. The tree health status can be monitored by direct observation in the field using the terrestrial method, or by remote sensing methods. Recent advances in technology have made it possible to use highresolution satellite imagery to monitor the damage. Materials and Methods: In order to estimate the health status of trees, the research area - Maksimir Forest Park - was visually interpreted by means of the WorldView 2 (WV2) satellite image, color composite (8, 5, 3). Such color composite was also used to delineate the strata. After delineation, a systematic sample of 25x25 m was laid over the stratum to help interpret the tree health status. Differences in tree damage were observed by comparing the WV2 images and other satellite images (Google Earth images from 2014 and 2016) recorded at different points in time. Field research was then conducted in order to inventory the current situation. Results: The main results of the research in Maksimir Forest Park include the calculation of damage indicators by tree species, as well as thematic maps with the spatial distribution of the mean damage (SO) and damage index (IO) for those tree species which are most represented in a particular stratum. Mean and significant damage of the most represented tree species and overall is also presented spatially in the form of thematic maps. A comparison of the results of WV2 satellite imagery and satellite images taken from Google Earth denoted a change in the tree health status, which confirms that satellite imagery can serve to inventory and track the condition in an area over a number of years. Field investigations and the assessment of tree health status confirmed the results obtained by satellite imagery interpretation. Conclusions: Since quality forest monitoring is based on systematic collection of forest data in any area or at any point in time, the obtained results not only represent the current health status, but also provide a basis for monitoring and predicting the future conditions. © 2018 by the Croatian Forest Research Institute.},

	abstract = {In this paper we propose a methodology for combining remotely sensed data with field measurements to assess selected tree parameters (diameter at breast height (DBH) and tree species) required by the i-Tree Eco model to estimate ecosystem services (ES) provided by urban trees. We determined values of ES provided by trees in 2017 in Racibórz (a city in South Poland) and estimated the loss of ES from January 1, 2017 to March 5, 2017, a period of changing legislation that temporarily allowed removal of trees on private property without any permission from city authorities. We applied Canopy Height Models (CHM; GSD 1.0 m) generated from two sets of ALS LiDAR point clouds (acquisitions on June 11, 2011 and March 5, 2017) and performed tree crown segmentations using the GEOBIA approach. Physical attributes were estimated for each tree using predictive models, developed based on field tree inventory. The reference areas for parameterizing the segmentation algorithm and assessing tree species composition were established in Racibórz, while reference data required for assessment of DBH were obtained from the MONIT-AIR project (from Municipality of Kraków). We found that in 2017, 988.79 ha of Racibórz (13.2 % of city area) was covered by the crowns of 264 471 trees, providing ES structural values worth over 384 mil €. The structural value of ES lost in the first months of 2017 (during which 5 075 trees were removed) was about 3.5 mil €. We concluded that in the face of information on tree crown cover that is often missing from city databases, tree inventories require application of a combination of multi-source and multi-resolution spatial analyses, including: administrative decisions for tree removal with exact location, predictive modelling of selected biometrical tree information, automatic crown segmentation on CHM and interpretation of regularly updated color infrared (CIR) aerial orthophotos. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {Indian cities are the hotspots of human population with population densities as high as 66,135 persons/sq km and are hence emerging as one of the significant CO2 emitters on par with cities of the developed nations. In this regard, quantification of Indian urban CO2 emissions at a finer resolution of space and time is becoming a crucial prerequisite for the implementation of India's National Action Plan on Climate Change. This paper presents the quantification of CO2 emissions of Chennai city at a fine spatial (1 km × 1 km) and temporal (diurnal, weekday-weekend, seasonal) resolution. In the present study, data sets of residential, industrial, commercial, traffic and waste management sectors were considered and bottom up approach was used for quantifying the CO2 emissions. Results indicated that the total annual CO2 emission of Chennai city was 2.12 Mt. Domestic (45.7%) and transportation (29.7%) sectors were identified as the larger CO2 emitters followed by power generation sector (17.4%). The average grid wise anthropogenic CO2 emission was found to be 0.01 ± 0.02 Mt/yr with peak CO2 emissions observed from the grids with point sources and minimal CO2 emissions from the grids overlaying on the urban forest of the city. The average per capita CO2 emission of Chennai was found to be 0.45 tons/yr which is less than the national per capita CO2 emission of 1.6 tons/year. The estimated CO2 fluxes due to anthropogenic emissions were in the range of 0-8.5 × 10-6 kg/m2/s with an average flux of 0.36 × 10-6 kg/m2/s. CO2 emissions during weekdays and weekends in summer season (5862.6 and 6235.58 tons/day) were slightly higher than in winter season (5540.8 and 5929.6 tons/day). Grids overlaying on commercial and residential zones showed higher CO2 emissions during morning (07:00-10:00 AM) and evening rush hours (07:00-09:00 PM) of a day. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Guangzhou is the largest city in subtropical South China with a significant tree cover and a long history of urban greening. Its precious tree stock is subject to a wide range of natural and artificial stresses, one of which is strong wind associated with thunderstorms and typhoons. On 9 April 1995, a windstorm of extreme intensity struck the city and brought havoc to the tree population. A detailed survey was conducted immediately after the storm to collect quantitative information on 1782 trees encompassing 89.5% of the total spoiled-tree population. The study was aimed at understanding the nature and extent of wind damage on urban trees with reference to species, dimension (age), site characteristics, land use and urban history. A brief review of tree composition, habitat conditions and tree management responsibilities in the city, and a computer inventory on urban trees established earlier, provided a benchmark for data interpretation. Damage was generally independent of size despite the conspicuous loss of some large and champion-calibre specimens. Tree size, however, was related to the mode of damage. Ten species constituted the bulk of the destruction. Roadsides and green spaces had somewhat different assemblages of afflicted species. Recent widespread construction activities had weakened many street trees and predisposed them to injuries. Old districts with more old trees were more seriously affected. North districts which registered much stronger winds took up over 80% of the toll. Different phases of management responses to the natural disaster and the related administrative organization were assessed. Management implications of the findings were discussed with a view of rationalizing responses and reducing future wind damage.},

Previous research has proved inconclusive and there is a lack of agreement on the importance of the variables involved, which means that the results cannot be extrapolated globally. This study presents a methodology to improve the understanding of tree root-sewer conflicts through a geostatistical analysis of a tree inventory and CCTV video fault reports. The methodology is applied to a 11 km2 case study in Bogotá, Colombia. The analysis used tree and sewer pipe georeferenced data, principal component analysis, and linear, Logit, and Poisson regression models. The proposed methodology identifies the pipe characteristics and the tree species most responsible for the root intrusion events into sewers. As expected, larger trees are prone to cause more pipe damage; therefore tree-pipe distance is a relevant parameter control for reducing potential deterioration. Cumulative precipitation and pipe length showed no effect on observed root intrusion events, and pipes made from brick had higher odds to present root intrusion in contrast with concrete pipes. The presented methodology uses readily available information and software, and can be modified depending on the requirements of each particular case study. This approach will therefore allow for more efficient use of costly, site-specific pipe investigations, and is especially useful for cases where there is a general lack of knowledge regarding the characteristics that favour the negative interactions between pipes and tree roots. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {Urban green infrastructure, including street trees, plays a key role in providing ecosystem services to urban residents. However, to fully understand the effective role of trees in the urban context, it is also necessary to evaluate the disservices that they can produce in the development of their functions if not managed in an adequate and integrated way. This contribution aims to demonstrate an approach to assess three disservices (pavement damage, aesthetic damage, likelihood of tree failure) of street trees at the municipal level, starting from the existing municipal tree inventory. In this case study, from the street tree population, a sample of approximately 5% of the trees was drawn by stratified random sampling, where the strata were composed of groups of tree species. In particular, a sampling scheme is adapted in which the probability to select a tree in the sample is greater for bigger trees, under the assumption that the bigger the trees the greater are the disservices caused. In this way, a greater precision of the estimates of the considered disservices for the population of urban trees is expected. The results show a high variability of disservices provision among species groups. The results also confirmed a positive correlation between the considered disservices and tree diameter at breast height, while other tree attributes such as total height and crown diameter were found to be positively related only to pavement damages. Finally, severe pruning can lead to a high level of the aesthetic and functional disservices even for shorter and younger street trees. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Although Brazil is recognized as a country of megadiversity many Brazilian cities have an overwhelming number of exotic street trees in their urban environments. Here we investigate this situation in the city of Fortaleza, Brazil’s fifth largest city. Through an extensive qualitative survey, complemented by published quantitative surveys, we developed the most complete inventory done to date in Fortaleza. We registered the largest possible number of plant species which we could record in the public treescape of the city. We recorded 219 tree species, of which 158 were exotic to Fortaleza’s ecosystems. Of the 61 native species, some were represented only by relictual individuals spared during urban growth and only 39 native species were cultivated plants. Most of these 39 cultivated natives are represented by a small number of individuals in the city, while most of common trees are exotic species. We show that many native plants that are potentially suitable for ornamental use in urban settings are being ignored and argue that exotics are overvalued, including some plants that are invasive. We also discuss the consequences of the predominance of alien species for the public perception of native biodiversity. We advocate that increasing the number of native plants in cities has many advantages from an ecological perspective. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {The benefits of green areas mostly depend on the trees’ dimension, which in the urban environment is not as predictable as it is in woodland. Growth models based on tree height and tree diameter at breast height have been largely employed to predict tree growth also in urbanised contexts. However, city environments differ from natural ones, and in addition to geographical influence, they present high variability in growth conditions within a few metres. Different urban conditions may influence tree vertical and diametral growth. The present study aims to jointly consider the effect of urban environment, maintenance practices and available space on the size growth of some tree species. Dendrometrical, space, management and status parameters of the sampled trees were collected during field surveys 14 years apart. Tree height and diameter at breast height data interpolations were realised and charted by an open-source graphing calculator to build three different growth equations (linear, logarithmic and logistic) for each of the five species considered regardless of tree growth conditions. The comparison between the comprehensive best-fitting models realised within this study and a USA inventory-based study highlighted quite similar tree growth trends, probably due to the consideration of both constrained and unconstrained trees. Furthermore, a study on the curves of same-growth condition trees of the same species was conducted. Generally, heavy pruning techniques such as control and pollard pruning, characterised by the removal of a consistent part of the tree crown, stand out as the main growth-limiting factor for the different species. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Integration of Landsat images and multisource data using spatial statistical analysis and geographical detector models can reveal the individual and interactive influences of anthropogenic activities and ecological factors on concentrations of atmospheric particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter (PM2.5). This approach has been used in many studies to estimate biomass and forest disturbance patterns and to monitor carbon sinks. However, the approach has rarely been used to comprehensively analyze the individual and interactive influences of anthropogenic factors (e.g., population density, impervious surface percentage) and ecological factors (e.g., canopy density, stand age, and elevation) on PM2.5 concentrations. To do this, we used Landsat-8 images and meteorological data to retrieve quantitative data on the concentrations of particulates (PM2.5), then integrated a forest management planning inventory (FMPI), population density distribution data, meteorological data, and topographic data in a Geographic Information System database, and applied a spatial statistical analysis model to identify aggregated areas (hot spots and cold spots) of particulates in the urban area of Jinjiang city, China. A geographical detector model was used to analyze the individual and interactive influences of anthropogenic and ecological factors on PM2.5 concentrations. We found that particulate concentration hot spots are mainly distributed in urban centers and suburbs, while cold spots are mainly distributed in the suburbs and exurban region. Elevation was the dominant individual factor affecting PM2.5 concentrations, followed by dominant tree species and meteorological factors. A combination of human activities (e.g., population density, impervious surface percentage) and multiple ecological factors caused the dominant interactive effects, resulting in increased PM2.5 concentrations. Our study suggests that human activities and multiple ecological factors effect PM2.5 concentrations both individually and interactively. We conclude that in order to reveal the direct and indirect effects of human activities and multiple factors on PM2.5 concentrations in urban forests, quantification of fusion satellite data and spatial statistical methods should be conducted in urban areas. © 2018 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Street tree inventory is an important part of urban forest inventory. Mobile laser scanning (MLS) technology has a strong data acquisition ability inside the canopy and the trunk and is suitable for parameter estimation at the tree level. The first and key step is to segment individual trees from the street MLS data, which is a challenging problem due to the semantic gap. This paper proposes an efficient and effective method for street tree segmentation from MLS data using deep learning-based image instance segmentation. First, the three-dimensional (3D) street point cloud captured by the MLS system is mapped to a two-dimensional (2D) RGB image. Next, pixelwise tree proposals are segmented from the street image by a trained deep learning-based image instance segmentation model. Then, the 2D segmentation mask is mapped back to the 3D street point cloud to generate pointwise tree proposals. Finally, the proposals are optimized to obtain the final results. To evaluate and verify algorithm performance, an MLS point cloud is collected from a 1481.8 m-long one-side urban street containing various objects. Three deep learning-based image instance segmentation algorithms, YOLACT, BlendMask, and YOLOv8, are carried out, and YOLOv8 achieves the best results in terms of both accuracy and speed. YOLOv8 has the highest segmentation accuracy, with IoU= 0.85:0.05:0.95, with an average segmentation time of 26 ms per image. In the experiments comparing the algorithms to the existing hierarchical segmentation and classification segmentation methods, the proposed method outperforms the other two methods in accuracy and is faster. The precision is 0.9988, the recall is 0.9986, the F1 score is 0.9987, and the time per scanline is 4.05 ms. Moreover, the proposed method can be applied to MLS data with a broad range of resolutions by introducing image resizing. © 2024 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {Mature urban tree canopy cover disrupts the local effects of urban heat islands and provides important ecosystem services such as energy savings through evaporation and shading, pollution removal, storm runoff control, and carbon sequestration. Sustainable urban tree canopy relies on the planting of juvenile trees. Typically, tree planting programs are only evaluated by the number of trees planted and there is a lack of analysis of juvenile trees post-planting. This study examines the value and distribution of energy savings provided by juvenile trees and how that value changes considering predicted tree growth and mortality by 2050. Using i-Tree Eco software, this study models the current and future ecosystem services provided to residents based on a juvenile tree inventory of 2271 street and residential trees planted in Massachusetts (USA) from 2014 to 2015 by the Greening the Gateway Cities Program (GGCP) in Chicopee and Fall River, MA. Juvenile trees planted by the GGCP provided $776 and $1520 (2018) in annual savings from ecosystem service in Chicopee and Fall River while services modeled to mature tree 2050 conditions show increased total annual savings of $2911 and $5840 in Chicopee and Fall River (2050). The mean total savings per tree per household were $0.77 in 2018 and $13.60 in 2050, with the majority from cooling energy savings in the summer. Services were maximized in neighborhoods where large numbers of trees were planted or when tree planting location (distance and orientation to the house) was optimized for highest savings. Analysis of the distribution of benefits reveals different planting strategies in Chicopee and Fall River. Ecosystem services from juvenile trees are concentrated in US Census block groups with more pre-existing tree canopy cover and lower median income. A tree planting density of two to three trees per acre was able to achieve the largest energy savings. Results of this study reinforce the importance of tree survivorship on sustaining the urban tree canopy to provide ecosystem services. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {Regression models to predict diameter at breast height (DBH) as a function of tree height and maximum crown radius were developed for Caribbean forests based on data collected by the U.S. Forest Service in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and Territory of the U.S. Virgin Islands. The model predicting DBH from tree height fit reasonably well (R2 = 0.7110), with strongest in subtropical moist and wet forest. The model predicting DBH from crown radius fit the data poorly (R2 = 0.2876), but improvements were made when the model was fit by forest life zone and crown radius measurement protocol. Models fit with both maximum crown radius and tree height had R-square values that ranged from 0.1803 for the subtropical dry forest to 0.8018 for the subtropical moist forest life zone where crown radius was measured with urban forest inventory protocols. Tree heights had stronger correlations with DBH than did crown radius, perhaps due to difficulties in measuring tree crown width or natural variability in this hurricane-disturbed environment. Models that use tree height have some potential for predicting DBH for use in Caribbean forest biomass and carbon estimation models, but the potential for error propagation by using DBH predicted from crown radius is too great to earn our recommendation for such applications. © 2009 Publisher of the International Journal of Mathematical and Computational Forestry & Natural-Resource Sciences Iles.},

The objectives of the current study were to: assess plant types and management strategies of the owners; woody species' composition, structure, and diversity; and estimate aboveground biomass of trees and associated carbon stock in private residential green infrastructure (PRGI) at Dilla town. This study was conducted at three kebeles, the lowest administrative unit in Ethiopia. Ninety-four households were randomly selected from a proportional sample size for each kebele. A complete inventory of woody species was done after measuring the area occupied by plants at each household. At plot level, the aboveground biomass of sampled trees was calculated by using an allometric biomass equation developed for agroforestry species. Diversity was described by using different indices The free software EstimateS 9.1.0 was used to generate data for the construction of sample-based rarefaction curves and SPSS version 20 for descriptive statistics. Based on plant types and arrangement, the households manage their PRGI in 15 categories on area size, ranging from 10 m2 to 1229 m2, with an average holding size of 207.5 m2. A total of 66 plant species belonging to 45 families were identified. Overall, a total of 1220 stem ha-1 contributed to an aboveground carbon stock of 64.35 ton ha-1 of which 50.4% is from fruit trees and the rest from timber trees. The results suggest that PRGIs can serve as reservoirs of non-native and native plant species, including five native tree species currently facing conservation concerns.  © 2022 Zebene Asfaw and Yohannes Zergaw.},

Las áreas naturales protegidas (ANP) han sido establecidas para prevenir la pérdida de estos bosques en México. Para evaluar el impacto temporal de las actividades de manejo de las ANP sobre la biodiversidad, se ha propuesto utilizar bioindicadores, como algunos grupos de macromicetos. El objetivo de este estudio fue evaluar los cambios temporales, durante los últimos 36 años, en la diversidad alfa, beta y gama de un ensamblaje de Xylaria en un ANP de BMM como un resultado de las actividades de manejo antropogénico. Métodos: Las recolectas fueron realizadas en un ANP de 31 ha de BMM en Xalapa, Veracruz, México, durante tres periodos de muestreo de 10 años y uno de seis (1980-2016), considerando ejemplares depositados en el herbario XAL y recolecciones realizadas por los autores principalmente en los últimos dos períodos. La riqueza, abundancia, similitud, recambio y la diversidad gama de los ensambles fue determinada y comparada entre periodos de muestreo. Resultados clave: De 3480 individuos pertenecientes a 30 especies de Xylaria, las más abundantes fueron X. scruposa, X. anisopleura, X. berteroi, X. cubensis, X. feejeensis, X. albocinctoides y X. arbuscula. La integración del inventario fue de 99.9%. La riqueza varió de seis (1990-1999) a 28 especies (2010-2016). El índice de Jaccard separó dos agrupaciones. La diversidad gama estuvo más influenciada por la diversidad beta que por la alfa. Conclusiones: Los ensamblajes de Xylaria son bioindicadores útiles y su monitoreo temporal puede proveer información del impacto del manejo del BMM. La dinámica temporal de estos ensamblajes depende parcialmente del manejo implementado históricamente en el ANP de BMM. La conservación eficiente del BMM dependerá del mantenimiento de las estrategias de manejo actuales y su integración a un plan de manejo a largo plazo del ANP que contiene BMM. © 2018, Instituto de Ecologiao.; Background and Aims: Tropical montane cloud forest (TMCF) is one of the most threatened ecosystems worldwide. Natural protected areas (NPAs) have been established to prevent further loss of these forests in Mexico. To assess whether management activities temporally impact the biodiversity of NPAs, the use of indicator groups, such as some groups of macromycetes, has been proposed. The aim of this study was to assess the temporal shifts over the last 36 years in the alpha, beta, and gamma diversity of a Xylaria assemblage in a NPA of TMCF as a result of anthropogenic management activities. Methods: Collections were performed in a 31 ha NPA of TMCF in Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico, during three 10 year and one six year sampling periods (1980-2016), taking into account specimens deposited in the herbarium XAL and collections performed by the authors, mainly in the two latter periods. Species number and abundance, compositional similarity, species turnover, and gamma diversity of assemblages were determined and compared among the sampling periods. Key results: Of 3480 individuals belonging to 30 Xylaria species, the most abundant species were X. scruposa, X. anisopleura, X. berteroi, X. cubensis, X. feejeensis, X. albocinctoides, and X. arbuscula. The inventory completeness was 99.9%. Species richness varied from six (1990-1999) to 28 species (2010-2016). Jaccard index separated two assemblage clusters. Gamma diversity was more influenced by beta diversity than alpha diversity. Conclusions: Xylaria assemblages are a useful bioindicator group and monitoring them over time may provide information about the impacts of management on TMCF ecosystems. Temporal dynamics of these assemblages partly depend on the historically implemented management in the NPA of TMCF. Effective conservation outcomes for TMCF will only be achieved if current management strategies are maintained and integrated into the long-term management framework of NPAs containing TMCF. © 2018, Instituto de Ecologiao.},

	abstract = {In order to maximize ecosystem services (ES), a proper planning of urban green areas is needed. In this study, the urban greenery of two Italian cities (Milan and Bologna) exposed to high levels of atmospheric pollutants was examined. Vegetation maps were developed through a supervised classification algorithm, trained over remote sensing images, integrated by local trees inventory, and used as input for the AIRTREE multi-layer canopy model. In both cities, a large presence of deciduous broadleaves was found, which showed a higher capacity to sequestrate CO2 (3,953,280 g m2 y−1), O3 (5677.76 g m2 y−1), and NO2 (2358.30 g m2 y−1) when compared to evergreen needle leaves that, on the other hand, showed higher performances in particulate matter removal (14,711.29 g m2 y−1 and 1964.91 g m2 y−1 for PM10 and PM2,5, respectively). We identified tree species with the highest carbon uptake capacity with values up to 1025.47 g CO2 m2 y−1 for Celtis australis, Platanus x acerifolia, Ulmus pumila, and Quercus rubra. In light of forthcoming and unprecedent policy measures to plant millions of trees in the urban areas, our study highlights the importance of developing an integrated approach that combines modelling and satellite data to link air quality and the functionality of green plants as key elements in improving the delivery of ES in cities. © 2023 by the authors.},

Assessment of street tree diversity is considered integral to sustainable street tree management and preservation of the ecosystem services and social benefits that street trees provide. This paper assesses street tree diversity in three northeastern U.S. states- New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania-by analyzing municipal street tree inventory data stratified by the 2012 USDA Plant Hardiness Zones. Despite the lesson learned from the historical devastation of overplanted American elms (Ulmus americana) by Dutch elm disease, and awareness of the contemporary threats posed to ashes (Fraxinus spp.) by the emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis) and to maples (Acer spp.), and other tree genera by the Asian longhorned beetle (Anoplophora glabripennis), results presented here indicate a current concentration of street trees among a relatively small number of species and genera, and in particular the dominance of maples as street trees. Results also show a positive relationship between street tree diversity and warmer average minimum winter temperatures. Consequently, there is a clear need in all three states for greater species and genus diversity in statewide and municipal street tree populations. However, meaningful impediments exist to increasing street tree diversity, especially in the short term. © 2017 International Society of Arboriculture.},

	abstract = {Urban trees play an important role in helping cities adapt to climate change, but also are vulnerable to changes in climate themselves. We developed an approach for assessing vulnerability of urban tree species and cultivars commonly planted in cities in the United States Upper Midwest to current and projected climate change through the end of the 21st century. One hundred seventy-eight tree species were evaluated for their adaptive capacity to a suite of current and future-projected climate and urban stressors using a weighted scoring system based on an extensive literature review. These scores were then evaluated and adjusted by leading experts in arboriculture in the region. Each species or cultivar’s USDA Hardiness Zone and American Horticultural Society Heat Zone tolerance was compared to current and future heat and hardiness zones for 14 municipalities across Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota using statistically downscaled climate data. Species adaptive capacity and zone tolerance was combined to assign each species one of five vulnerability categories for each location. We determined the number of species and trees in each category based on the most recent municipal street tree data for each location. Under a scenario of less climate change (RCP 4.5), fewer than 2% of trees in each municipality were considered highly vulnerable across all 14 municipalities. Under a scenario of greater change (RCP 8.5), upward of 25% of trees were considered highly vulnerable in some locations. However, the number of vulnerable trees varied greatly by location, primarily because of differences in projected summer high temperatures rather than differences in species composition. Urban foresters can use this information as a complement to other more traditional considerations used when selecting trees for planting. © Copyright © 2021 Brandt, Johnson, North, Faje and Rutledge.},

A pilot study was carried out on a representative section of one of the major rail lines in Sydney in 2016. A detailed inventory of vegetation on the selected site was obtained through a field survey and a variety of tools were used including i-Tree Eco to benchmark current carbon sequestration and storage (CS&S) levels. Study outcomes include the existing carbon capacity of the rail corridor's above-ground (and substrate) biomass and air pollution reduction. It also presents estimates of CS&S potential by identifying future planting areas within the pilot study corridor.

	abstract = {Urban schoolyards are essential in biodiversity conservation; they provide numerous ecosystem services to students, school managers, and the city where the schools are located. However, limited or no studies have explored the role of urban schoolyards in both biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration. This study, therefore, assessed the structure and values of urban schoolyards forest in the cities of Niamey and Maradi in the Niger Republic. A total of 60 schools was selected purposively from Maradi and Niamey (30 schools in each city), where the data were collected through a face-to-face survey. Additionally, a forest inventory and participatory observations were conducted to gather the dendrometric data and animal biodiversity. The findings revealed that, a total of 97 different tree species belonging to 35 families and 81 genera. In addition, neem tree and Fabaceae (22 species) were found to be the dominant tree species and botanical family respectively in the schoolyards of both cities. The similarity index was 64% indicating high similarity between the floras of the schoolyards in the two cities. The biomass value equals about 48.91 t/ha and 27.49 t/ha carbon stock in the primary schools of Niamey and Maradi respectively. Furthermore, the analysis of the structure of the urban schoolyard forests showed high values of structural parameters indicating the vitality/health/integrity of the forest. The ability of students to name plants, animals, and ecosystem services of their schoolyards is significantly low. This study recommends the use of multipurpose woody plant species in urban greening school initiatives for quality education. Furthermore, the study recommends a further investigation of the effects of the school urban forest structure on the students' academic performance and the allergenic potential of woody species found in urban schools. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {With the effects of climate change, people are increasingly facing human-perceived heat stress (HPHS), which describes the combined effects of high temperature, high humidity, and low surface wind speed. HPHS has a significant impact on industrial and agricultural production, people's lifestyles, and public health. However, the characteristics of HPHS with respect to changes and influencing factors have not been fully investigated using dynamic classification of urban, suburban, and rural stations based on absolute and relative thresholds of seven HPHS indices in Southwest China. The results of this study revealed that, first, during the period 1961–2019, the normal annual and seasonal HPHS values and extreme HPHS days increased significantly, while the extreme HPHS values for the seven HPHS indices decreased. Second, based on the absolute and relative thresholds, the frequency and intensity of the impact of urbanization differed in four regions, and in Yunnan and Guizhou in particular. Different HPHS indices and different dynamic station classification methods result in different estimations of the effects of urbanization on annual and seasonal changes in the regional climate. Therefore, choosing an appropriate dynamic station classification method and considering the applicability of different indices in different seasons in different regions is very important. Third, the Granger causality test shows that the percentage of stations with Granger causality between landscape composition indices and seven extreme HPHS is the highest among all influencing factors. At the same time, boosted regression tree detection also showed that the landscape composition indices had the highest contribution percentage to the seven extreme HPHS. Therefore, rational planning of land-use patterns, especially in relation to urban forest land, grassland, wetland, and water bodies (including vertical landscape composition, configuration planning, and building density and layout) has implications for the realization of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular SDG 11, Sustainable Cities and Communities. © 2022},

Inventories were built from lineal plots of 250 m2 and included trees with DBH equal to or greater than 10 cm at a height of 1.3 m above ground. Sixty-nine families and 759 species, of which eight were officially listed as endangered (Brazilian National Flora: Ministry of Environment, Normative Instruction of September, 2008; Pará State Flora: Decree N°. 802 of February 2008) were recorded. These endangered species are: Aspidosperma desmanthum Benth. ex Müll. Arg. (Apocynaceae), Cedrela odorata L.

Standl. (Bignoniaceae), Mezilaurus itauba (Meisn.) Taub. ex Mez (Lauraceae) and Qualea coerulea Aubl. (Vochysiaceae). Emergency actions such as implementing management plans for already existing Conservation Units, the creation of new such units in areas of primary forest fragments (as in the case of the Amafrutas reserve), as well as the intensification of actions of surveillance and monitoring, should be undertaken by Federal, State, and Municipal environmental agencies so as to ensure the conservation of these last primary forest remnants in the metropolitan area of Belém.},

	abstract = {Quantification of biophysical parameters of urban trees is important for urban planning, and for assessing carbon sequestration and ecosystem services. Airborne lidar has been used extensively in recent years to estimate biophysical parameters of trees in forested ecosystems. However, similar studies are largely lacking for individual trees in urban landscapes. Prediction models to estimate biophysical parameters such as height, crown area, diameter at breast height, and biomass for over two thousand individual trees were developed using best subsets multiple linear regression for a study area in central Oklahoma, USA using point cloud distributional metrics from an Optech ALTM 2050 lidar system. A high level of accuracy was attained for estimating individual tree height (R 2 = 0.89), dbh (R 2 = 0.82), crown diameter (R 2 = 0.90), and biomass (R 2 = 0.67) using lidar-based metrics for pooled data of all tree species. More variance was explained in species-specific estimates of biomass (R 2 = 0.68 for Juniperus virginiana to 0.84 for Ulmus parviflora) than in estimates from broadleaf deciduous (R 2 = 0.63) and coniferous (R 2 = 0.45) taxonomic groups-or the data set analysed as a whole (R 2 = 0.67). The metric crown area performed particularly well for most of the species-specific biomass equations, which suggests that tree crowns should be delineated accurately, whether manually or using automatic individual tree detection algorithms, to obtain a good estimation of biomass using lidar-based metrics. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {The importance of plants in the urban environment is sufficiently demonstrated by their potential and the ecosystem services they generate for the environment and populations. The present work aimed at assessing the contribution of avenue trees to carbon sequestration in the municipality of Sèmè-Podji in Benin. The methodological approach used has allowed making the inventory of trees along 26 kilometers of managed roadways. The diversity and structure parameters were computed to assess the floristic potential, the diameter and height structure of the trees, then the sequestered carbon from the allometric equations established for urban environments. The results revealed 19 species grouped into 12 families and 17 genus along the explored streets. Shannon's average diversity index (3.25±0.13 bits) and Pielou's equitability (0.76±0.04) explain the dominance of a few species, among which the most representative are Terminalia catappa (33.79%), Delonix regia (12.5%), and Khaya senegalensis (9.72%). The diameter and height structures are irregular, with average of 46.75 ± 33.46 cm and 10.35 ± 5.33 m respectively. The aerial biomass for the inventoried streets is 756.16 t/ha, corresponding to a carbon stock of 378.17 t/ha, that is the equivalent of 102.09 t of CO2 per hectare. It appeared from this study that the floristic procession and the structural characteristics of the avenue trees are limited to ensure the socio-ecological functions in the municipality of Sèmè-Podji. However, this information could encourage decision-makers to take reforestation measures to increase the vegetation cover of the streets and for better management of the city's urban forestry. © 2022 International Formulae Group.

	abstract = {Management of urban trees is key to sustaining and increasing essential ecosystem services, and most management decisions are made based on urban tree inventories. Vitality is one of the key parameters when conducting tree inventories. However, consensus on how vitality should be assessed is lacking, and there is limited understanding of how visual vitality assessments are affected by aspects of different professional background, growing sites and tree age. In a Delphi study with 19 participants completing the whole study, we asked urban foresters and ecologists to assess the vitality of 21 trees in urban and rural settings and to rate how important 40 different parameters were for their assessment of each tree's vitality. The data obtained were analysed using Cronbach's alpha, unconstrained ordination, hierarchal clustering and indicator values. In testing for differences, mixed general linear models and constrained ordination were used. Professionals participating in the study showed good overall agreement in ranking trees as more or less vital, but with large differences in what was considered a fully vital tree. When performing vitality assessments, the parameters used differed between old and young trees, and between urban and rural sites. There was also a systematic difference between urban foresters and ecologists in performing tree vitality assessments, with ecologists consistently rating tree vitality higher and using fewer parameters. Parameters used for assessing vitality comprised aspects relating to sign of decay, external damage, loss/death of biomass, growth performance and site conditions. Vitality should thus be regarded as a complex parameter that needs calibration-based assessment approaches and the person performing the assessment should always be included as an additional variable. Overall, this study clearly showed the need to establish consensus on how tree vitality should be assessed and rated. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The development of tree inventories and open data bases provides green space managers a better understanding of tree morphological diversity in urban areas. However, studies on tree genetic diversity in cities remain rare. The aim of our study is to provide better knowledge on tree intra- and interspecific diversity to improve tree management in urban areas. We characterized 83 individuals of Tilia species and clones in streets and parks in Paris (France) based on both morphological characters (leaves, fruits and twigs) and genetic profiling by using nuclear microsatellite markers. We found five species through morphological identification: Tilia cordata, Tilia dasystyla, Tilia ×euchlora, Tilia ×europaea and Tilia platyphyllos. Analysis of genetic profiles allowed to distinguish three genetic groups correlated to T. cordata, T. ×euchlora and T. platyphyllos. Tilia ×euchlora had the largest number of the same clonal profile (20 individuals out of 36) in Paris while no clone was found in T. platyphyllos group. In some cases, clones were planted in the same street for aesthetic purposes. This can increase disease risk and diminish resilience to climate change. Knowledge on genetic variability between and within species is essential to hedge those risks and for evaluating individual responses to environmental conditions. Our study shows that production and purchasing practices by green space managers need new insights and that tree nurseries can play a crucial role in supplying trees with diverse genetics. Green space managers can reinforce diversity where possible in some areas (development of urban forests, greening of secondary streets or sidewalks, etc.) to improve ecosystem services in urban areas. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {Volatile organic compound (VOCs) emission is an important cause of photochemical smog and particulate pollution in urban areas, and urban vegetation has been presented as an important source. Different tree species have different emission levels, so adjusting greening species collocation is an effective way to control biogenic VOC pollution. However, there is a lack of measurements of tree species emission in subtropical metropolises, and the factors influencing the species-specific differences need to be further clarified. This study applied an in situ method to investigate the isoprene emission rates of 10 typical tree species in subtropical metropolises. Photosynthesis and related parameters including photosynthetic rate, intercellular CO2 concentration, stomatal conductance, and transpiration rate, which can influence the emission rate of a single species, were also measured. Results showed Salix babylonica always exhibited a high emission level, whereas Elaeocarpus decipiens and Ligustrum lucidum maintained a low level throughout the year. Differences in photosynthetic rate and stomatal CO2 conductance are the key parameters related to isoprene emission among different plants. Through the establishment of emission inventory and determination of key photosynthetic parameters, the results provide a reference for the selection of urban greening species, as well as seasonal pollution control, and help to alleviate VOC pollution caused by urban forests. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Background The Atlantic Forest is a hotspot for biodiversity, an area which houses high species richness and endemism, but with high level of threat. With reference to the herpetofauna, until recently there has been no detailed information regarding diversity of snakes recorded in the Atlantic Forest, the number of endemic species and their distribution ranges. While these basic data were missing, large areas of original forest have continued to be lost to increased urbanization and human population, representing a severe threat to the biodiversityNew information We recorded 28 snake species in our study area. Dipsadidae was the richest family with 14 species, followed by Colubridae (eight species), Boidae (two species), Viperidae (two species), and Anomalepididae, Elapidae and Typhlopidae (one species each). Most species were forest inhabitants (61%), of which 13 are endemic to the Atlantic Forest. There were no clearly defined species clusters regarding species composition. None of the species recorded in Niterói are listed as threatened in the Brazilian Redlist. However, most of them are strongly associated with forested areas and, perhaps, are not adapted to live in small fragments. Thus, more initiatives should be implemented to evaluate the true conservation status of these species in order to better protect them. © Citeli N et al.},

The environmental or socio-economic benefits desired with street trees come from the top of the trees and from the covering mantle formed over the streets. In this way, the goal of this research was to analyze the distribution and dynamics of crown area classes of trees measured in two inventories held in Curitiba streets trees in 1984 and 2010. Data distribution in crown area classes, for the total data and each parcel sampled, demonstrated that there is a tendency for a descending distribution curve type, typical of multi-year and multispecific stands, both for the year 1984 as for the year 2010, with greater frequency of individuals in the crown area class 0{box drawings light vertical and right} 50m 2. However, when data was analyzed for the main species it was found that for some of them the distribution curve changed from a descending type, in 1984, to a unimodal type, in 2010. There was greater_ recruitment of remaining trees in classes 50 - 100m 2 and 100 - 150m 2 and larger class removal of class 0{box drawings light vertical and right} 50m 2. It was concluded that it was possible to understand, in part, behavioral characteristics of the species and verify signs of maturing of Curitiba streets trees when analyzed 26 years later.},

Trees on a university campus and in city parks also help to provide an environment in which students and visitors can study and relax. A critical decision facing urban foresters, arborists, and planners involves deciding when an existing tree should be removed and replaced; it is a decision often based on an evaluation of the tree's health, condition, and safety concerns. This project surveyed a total of 3,335 trees with 79 species on the campus of Stephen F. Austin State University (Nacogdoches, Texas, U.S.) and 1,572 trees with 44 species in Nacogdoches city parks. Tree health and replacement values of the two groups were statistically compared, as were the diversities of the two. Finally, the tree health conditions and distributions were spatially analyzed using a geographic information system. Although there was statistical evidence indicating that the campus trees were significantly healthier than the city park trees, neither of their biodiversity status was desirable. It is important to identify and remove trees with extensive wood decay and introduce new species when performing forest maintenance and management. © 2014 International Society of Arboriculture.},

	abstract = {The Dendropark at the Faculty of Forestry in Skopje, North Macedonia, was established as an ‘outdoor museum’ with a collection of forest trees and shrub vegetation. The collection was planted in 1950 on the area of 4.05 ha, and includes 336 taxa from native Macedonian and Balkan endemic dendroflora and introduced species from around the world. The Dendropark, like the other botanical gardens all over the world, offers a unique resource that facilitate earlier detection of the potential invasive threats to forest tree species. The inventoried population includes 444 trees belonging to 43 families. The three most represented families are Pinaceae with 21 species (19.4% of the inventoried plants), Cupressaceae with 16 species (15.8%) and Rosaceae with 18 species (7.4%). The 2014 survey indicated that 33.8% of the total number of trees were rated with good health status, 1.8% as very good, 31.1% rated as fair, while 24.5% were poor. Approximately 4.1% were rated to be in a critical state (in a state of decline), and 4.7% of trees were dead. The assessment of health status of plants in the Dendropark could be used as a valuable asset to planners and decision makers and provides information about the quality, quantity and location of natural resources in urban areas. Identifying changes in plant species composition and presence of invasive pests and diseases helps maintaining healthy urban forests. © 2022 Hrvatsko Sumarsko Drustvo. All rights reserved.},

Early fusion was used to combine the LiDAR data with the orthophotos while intermediate fusion was used to combine both with the PlanetScope data. An ablation study was performed to assess the contribution of each image source. The proposed workflow reached an overall accuracy (OA) of 90.7%. The orthophotos contribute most to the accuracy of the model (80.9% OA) followed by the multi-temporal PlanetScope data (68.2% OA). The early fusion of the LiDAR data and the orthophotos did not prove effective and did not increase model accuracy any further. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Numerous studies on housing markets indicate that neighborhood amenities such as trees and open space increase property values while the presence of hazardous facilities, pollution and flooding risks decreases housing prices. However, previous studies have focused on the direct impacts of neighborhood characteristics on housing prices using the Hedonic Price Model (HPM). Potential interactive relationships among neighborhood characteristics have not been clearly tested. This study examines direct impacts of urban forest on property values and indirect impact on the relationship between Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) chemical facilities and tax base property values in Tarrant County, Texas. Distance to hazardous chemical sites and the amount of foliage coverage within neighborhoods are measured using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and regressed to tax base property values. To test the indirect impact of trees coverage on the relationship between TRI sites and property values, the moderation model is examined with more foliage coverage (MF) parcels and less foliage coverage (LF) parcels. The empirical result of this study confirms the findings of previous studies suggesting negative influences of hazardous facilities, and positive effects from trees on housing prices. Furthermore, this study uncovers that amount of tree coverage within a neighborhood have an indirect impact on housing values. Specifically, trees in neighborhood environments significantly reduce the negative influence of distance to TRI hazardous chemical facilities. Negative influences of TRI hazardous chemical facilities appear not to be significant in many-treed neighborhoods while hazardous chemical facilities show negative influences on housing values in neighborhoods less-covered by trees. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {The urban forest is commonly associated to city parks and gardens; however, cemeteries are also an important component of this type of forest. Cemeteries have the particularity to be a multifunctional services provider, because in addition to the funerary services that they facilitate, usually they have extensive tree covers that improve the aesthetics, functionality and environmental conditions of the place and the urban surroundings. The characteristics of the tree cover of Dolores Civil Cemetery was never determined before, and no information exists about the structure of the tree cover, the physical and sanitary condition of trees, as well as the environmental services that provide. Dolores cemetery is the oldest of its kind and the largest in Mexico City (112 ha), (and probably of the country), and preserves historic and emblematic sites like the Pantheon of Illustrious Persons. Tree cover diagnostic was implemented through a sampling inventory with 102 sites of 600 m2, where 1051 arboreal individuals (dbh of 5 cm and over), and 30 young trees were recorded from 44 species. Frequency and relative dominance of the species were determined, as well as the mean values in such aspects as height, dbh, basal diameter, crown coverture, physical and sanitary conditions, and maintenance requirements. The entire tree cover characteristics was estimated considering the sampling data, in addition to the environmental services that provide and their economic value. This publication creates a precedent, which could be useful to improve the condition of the tree cover in the cemetery by the personnel in charge. © 2023, Instituto de Ecologia, A.C.

	abstract = {Rapid growth of the Chinese urban population and the expansion of urban areas have led to changes in urban forest structure and composition, and consequently changes in vegetation carbon storage. The purpose of this study is to quantify the effects of urbanization on vegetation carbon storage in Xiamen, a city located in southern China. Data used for this study were collected from 39,723 sample plots managed according to the forest management planning inventory program. Data from these plots were collected in 4 non-consecutive years: 1972, 1988, 1996 and 2006. The study area was divided into three zones, which were defined according to their level of urbanization: the urban core, the suburban zone, and the exurban zone. Total vegetation carbon storage and the vegetation carbon density for each study period were calculated for each zone. Our results show that urban vegetation carbon storage has increased by 865,589.71. t during the period from 1972 to 2006 (34 years) in Xiamen, with a rapid increase between 1972 and 1996, then relatively little change between 1996 and 2006. The increase in vegetation carbon storage is mainly due to the large percentages of the suburban and exurban areas which exist in Xiamen city, and the implementation of reforestation programs in these two zones. The percentage of total regional carbon storage in the city center (urban core), suburbs and exurbs was 5%, 23% and 72%, respectively. This demonstrates that the exurbs store the majority of vegetation carbon, and thus play a critical role in the vegetation carbon storage of the study area. The intensification of urbanization in the future will likely expand the urban core and reduce the area of the suburbs and exurbs, and thus potentially decrease total vegetation carbon storage. This article concludes with a discussion of the implications of these results for vegetation carbon management and urban landscape planning. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Survey responses from 528 officials in 356 municipalities defined the developmental status of municipal street tree programs and the attitudes of three types of officials: elected chief officials, public works administrators, and municipal solicitors. In sustained programs, which had an ordinance, tree commission, inventory, and management plan, officials had more positive attitudes about trees than in developing programs, which had at least one of these elements, or in communities without a tree program. However, even in the latter, approximately half of the officials believed that benefits of street trees outweigh costs and any disadvantages, and 62% favored starting a tree program. No tree programs exist in 46% of the cities, 82% of the boroughs, and 97% of the townships, so there are many opportunities and also important barriers. Incomplete understanding of the benefits of trees and tree care practices leads to low public support, insufficient funding, and inadequate personnel and equipment. Most officials favor spending some money on trees but regard tree programs as less important than other civic responsibilities. Officials may be persuaded to start or improve tree programs by explaining benefits more fully and how public safety can be improved by proper pruning, inventories that locate dangerous trees, and management plans that arrange to remove them. Furthermore, funding may be alleviated by using volunteers, grants, and available technical advice. ©2008 International Society of Arboriculture.},

	abstract = {The biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions of nine urban tree species were studied to assess the air quality impacts from planting a large quantity of these trees in the City and County of Denver, Colorado, through the Mile High Million tree-planting initiative. The deciduous tree species studied were Sugar maple, Ohio buckeye, northern hackberry, Turkish hazelnut, London planetree, American basswood, Littleleaf linden, Valley Forge elm, and Japanese zelkova. These tree species were selected using the i-Tree Species Selector (itreetools.org). BVOC emissions from the selected tree species were investigated to evaluate the Species Selector data under the Colorado climate and environmental growing conditions. Individual tree species were subjected to branch enclosure experiments in which foliar emissions of BVOC were collected onto solid adsorbent cartridges. The cartridge samples were analyzed for monoterpenes (MT), sesquiterpenes (SQT), and other C10-C15 BVOC using thermal desorption-gas chromatography-flame ionization detection/mass spectroscopy (GC-FID/MS). Individual compounds and their emission rates (ER) were identified. MT were observed in all tree species, exhibiting the following total MT basal emission rates (BER; with a 1-σ lower bound, upper bound uncertainty window): Sugar maple, 0.07 (0.02, 0.11)μgg-1h-1; London planetree, 0.15 (0.02, 0.27)μgg-1h-1; northern hackberry, 0.33 (0.09, 0.57)μgg-1h-1; Japanese zelkova, 0.42 (0.26, 0.58)μgg-1h-1; Littleleaf linden, 0.71 (0.33, 1.09)μgg-1h-1; Valley Forge elm, 0.96 (0.01, 1.92)μgg-1h-1; Turkish hazelnut, 1.30 (0.32, 2.23)μgg-1h-1; American basswood, 1.50 (0.40, 2.70)μgg-1h-1; and Ohio buckeye, 6.61 (1.76, 11.47)μgg-1h-1. SQT emissions were seen in five tree species with total SQT BER of: London planetree, 0.11 (0.01, 0.20)μgg-1h-1; Japanese zelkova, 0.11 (0.05, 0.16)μgg-1h-1; Littleleaf linden, 0.13 (0.06, 0.21)μgg-1h-1; northern hackberry, 0.20 (0.11, 0.30)μgg-1h-1; and Ohio buckeye, 0.44 (0.06, 0.83)μgg-1h-1. The following trees exhibited emissions of other C10-C15 volatile organic compounds (VOC): Littleleaf linden, 0.15 (0.10, 0.20)μgg-1h-1; Ohio buckeye, 0.39 (0.14, 0.65)μgg-1h-1; and Turkish hazelnut, 0.72 (0.49, 0.95)μgg-1h-1. All tree species studied in this experiment were confirmed to be low isoprene emitters. Compared to many other potential urban tree species, the selected trees can be considered low to moderate BVOC emitters under Colorado growing conditions, with total emission rates one-tenth to one-hundredth the rates of potential high-BVOC emitting trees. The emissions data were used to estimate the impact of this targeted tree planting on the urban BVOC flux and atmospheric VOC burden. Selecting the low-emitting tree species over known high BVOC emitters is equivalent to avoiding VOC emissions from nearly 500,000 cars from the inner city traffic. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {While urban areas are often considered to be comprised chiefly of artificial surfaces, they can contain a substantial portion of green space and a great diversity of natural habitats. These spaces include public parks, private gardens and street trees, all of which can provide valuable environmental services, such as improved air quality. Trees play a particular role in cities as they are often placed along roadsides and in the median strip of busy streets. As such they regulate access to sunshine, restrict airflow, provide shelter, scavenge air pollutants and manage noise at the street level. A tree planting policy can be an important part of a broader environmental strategy aimed at improving the quality of life in urban areas but this requires up-to-date knowledge of the current tree stock, which does not exist for Dublin. This article presents an inventory of trees in Dublin's city centre, defined as the area between the Grand and Royal canals. The results show that there are over 10,000 trees in the study area representing a density of 684 trees km 2 or one tree to approximately every 50 residents of the city centre. The tree canopy extent when in full foliage was nearly 1 km2 in extent or 6% of the study area. A more detailed analysis of those trees planted along streets shows little species variation but clear distinction in the sizes of trees, which is indicative of the age of planting.

	abstract = {Mapping tree crown is critical for estimating the functional and spatial distribution of ecosystem services. However, accurate and up-to-date urban crown mapping remains a challenge due to the time-consuming nature of field sampling and spatial heterogeneity. Another challenge is the data cost, which is always a concern for low-cost processing of forest maps on large scales. Here, we developed a novel working framework by integrating an advanced deep learning technology, the Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Mask R-CNN) model with Google Earth images to detect tree crown cover in New York's Central Park, which is a typical testbed for an urban forest area with highly heterogeneous tree crown cover. The results indicated that the tree number detection rate estimated by the Mask R-CNN crown detection model was 82.8% and the crown area detection rate was 81.8% for the entire study area. The model detected isolated trees and closed forest trees areas with a recall of 87.5% and 81.6% of the tree numbers, respectively. The analysis indicates that the tree crown detection model could accurately detect tree crowns under highly complex environments and demonstrates great potential to map urban tree crown covers. © 2022 The Authors},

We found that the spatial extent of the floodplain forest remained considerably stable in spite of an overall decline in the entire floodplain area from the period where the city first experienced industrialisation in the 19th century to now. However, with river regulations and the alteration of forest management from coppice-with-standards forest to high forest in the 19th century, major changes can be found in the tree species composition of the floodplain forest. Comparing these findings with references from other European floodplain forests we discuss the impact of historical and current forest management as well as the city location's influence on the extent and tree species composition of urban floodplain forests. For urban forest management in particular there is a great need to integrate biophysical, historical and forestry knowledge when predicting future developmental trends. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

About 99% of the area of the EEL system is located in southern Miami-Dade. Pine rockland forests are primarily in the outer suburbs of the county where fire can be used most effectively for management. Hardwood hammock forests are distributed throughout the county including within the urban core. All 56 EEL forested sites under study contained at least one rare plant species. Small sites often contained high numbers of rare species per unit area, but presumably at lower population sizes. The type of upland forest was not related to the mean richness of rare or state-listed plant species.

Therefore, there is a growing interest to improve the environmental performance of the urban wood supply chain by quantifying the environmental impacts of creating high-value products from urban tree removals to enhance its utilization. By surveying existing urban wood utilization operations for primary data in two major cities: Baltimore, Maryland, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a new life cycle inventory (LCI) dataset per m3 of dry urban hardwood lumber and live edge slabs was created. Incorporating the new LCI data into life cycle assessment method, the total global warming (GW) impact of converting urban trees to kiln-dried lumber was estimated to be 122 kg CO2 eq and 336 kg CO2eq per m3 of lumber produced for Baltimore and Milwaukee, respectively. In both cases, the total environmental impact of the product was dominated by the conversion of urban trees to kiln dried lumber at the sawmill processing stage. Using scenario analysis for the source of heat generation used in kiln (force) drying wood, substituting wood fuel from coproducts for natural gas in a boiler for Milwaukee resulted in a substantial reduction in fossil-derived GW impact. Urban and traditional hardwood lumber production follow similar GW impact trajectories over their life-cycle stages with the lumber processing stage having the highest environmental impacts for both. Increasing the overall lumber yield and decreasing kiln (force) drying would substantially improve the environmental performance of urban hardwood lumber and help make it comparable to traditional lumber. © 2022},

Therefore, it was obtained information related to: tree species, location of the crown and trunk, the trunk orientation, plant, root interception of the ride, silvicultural treatments, total height and the first bifurcation, as well as characteristics of road space. Eight hundred and sixty-eight individuals were recorded, of which 679 were cataloged in 71 tree species. The most frequent species was Caesalpinia pluviosa, (13.6% of the total), followed by Ficus benjamina (10.4%), Lagerstroemia indica (5.0%) and Terminalia catappa (4.8%). The condition of the trunk, 68.8% of the individual trees showed no problems, 85.7% of the observed trees have adequate sympodial guidance; few trees had damages related to plant health that may interfere with their integrity and, or, longevity, 69.6% did not interfere directly on the sidewalk; 32.8% of the trees needed pruning for being above the electrical wiring; 0.5% needed replacing and 5.7% required removal. With respect to the total height of the trees, 63.0% grew less than 5 m, and 65.3% present height of the first trunk bifurcation lower than 1.80 m. Bairro Primavera was highlighted by the largest number of trees in its urbanization. In contrast, Jardim Amelia had only one individual. Thus, it is observed that each neighborhood has its particularity and maintenance actions and enrichment related to both number of species and number of individuals should be considered in urban planning-tree in the city.},

	abstract = {Climate change negotiations, assessments, and greenhouse gas inventory guidelines have all but bypassed bamboo. Disallowing stands of tree-like bamboos as forests disparages their function in the carbon (C) cycle, and disregards pillars of smallholder livelihoods. Exposing bamboo not as a panacea, but as an overlooked option for C conservation, sequestration, and adaptation, we screen details of distribution, morphology, growth, physiology, and impacts for pertinence to climate change. Additional to 40 million hectares of existing bamboo forests, many potential host countries for C projects harbor suitable sites. Definitions, methods and default values, such as the root/shoot- ratio, biomass conversion factors, allometric equations and sampling variables need adjusting. Rapid maturation, persistent rhizomes, a rich palette of species, and wind-firmness may mitigate risk. Bamboos can accommodate agro-and urban forestry, and reign in unsustainable shifting cultivation. Distribution functions of bamboo biomass stocks and growths do not deviate drastically from those of trees. If anything, bamboo stocks are slightly lower, and growths slightly higher, with medians of 87 t*ha-1 and 10. 5 t*ha-1*yr-1, respectively. However, bamboo's outstanding socio-economic effects might well determine its future in mitigation and adaptation. Early, continuous yields, selective harvesting on even small parcels of land, low capital and high labor intensity, virtually 100% conversion efficiency to about 1,500 products, and, typically, 75% of economic returns benefiting rural people are advantageous attributes. Regional studies on suitability, silviculture, yields, economics, risk, and C assessment would strengthen bamboo's function as 'the poor man's timber' and promote its niche as the smallholder's C sink. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	abstract = {The sampling efficiency of pitfall traps and Winkler litter extraction in northern deciduous forests was compared using ants. Both techniques are among the most common methods used to measure the diversity of organisms active on the forest floor. During 20052006, 90 Winkler and 180 pitfall trap samples from urban forest fragments in northeastern Ohio obtained 9,203 ants representing 31 species. Winklers captured all 31 species, whereas pitfall traps collected a total of 24 species. Winkler samples accumulated species more rapidly than did pitfall traps and had greater total species richness and higher abundance of ants recorded. Consistent with other studies, Winkler sampling was found to catch a greater number of smaller ants, whereas pitfall trapping caught a greater number of large-bodied ants. According to estimates of expected species richness, the combination of the two sampling techniques allowed for the collection of ≈90% of the ants expected in the surveyed area. Site variation had little effect on the inherent differences in sampling efficacy between the two methods. Either technique adequately collected samples for broad comparisons and documentation of the more typical and representative ant fauna, but Winkler extraction exhibited the advantage of a more complete inventory. The application of both techniques should be considered if the aims of a study require estimation of community properties, such as relative abundance. © 2009 Entomological Society of America.},

From 2004 to 2010 in one member of each pair, rapid removal of American elm (Ulmus americana) trees that displayed symptoms of Dutch elm disease was practiced: newly symptomatic trees were removed within six weeks of symptom detection. The remaining member of each pair continued with autumn or winter removal of symptomatic trees. Treed urban study areas were selected in each community, and in 2008 an inventory of U. americana was taken in these areas. From this inventory and from records of tree removals, estimates of the number of living U. americana and prevalence of Dutch elm disease were made for each year from 2004 to 2010. Following the switch to rapid removal, the annual prevalence of Dutch elm disease in rapid removal communities was 1.5 ± 0.2%, signifcantly lower than in communities with autumn/winter removal (3.1 ± 0.4%). The study authors estimate that in similar areas the value of the elm resource after 10 years would be almost CAD $600,000/km 2 greater if rapid removal rather than autumn/winter removal were practiced. Therefore, under conditions similar to those in these communities, rapid removal should be a component of management programs for Dutch elm disease. © 2012 International Society of Arboriculture.},

Decision tree classification was employed to conduct the final classification result. Using this profile approach, six major species (Maple, Ash, Birch, Oak, Spruce, Pine) of trees on the York University (Ontario, Canada) campus were successfully identified.

	abstract = {With the rapid development of urbanization, urban ecological construction gets more and more attention from urban management departments. Most ecological effort in urban areas are derived from trees, whose inventory are essential component of urban nature resources. In this paper, we used dynamical local maximum to detection treetop as tree location from high resolution satellite images and remote sensing images, which come from Google earth. A process to detect tree position is achieved in this paper. Firstly, a vegetation index excess green minus excess red (ExG-ExR) is applied to extract tree region from original imagery. And then a mature watershed-segmentation algorithm is used to delineate individual tree crowns after a series morphological operation. Finally, we use three weighted method to calculate the centroid of tree crown compared with the manual marks. For accessing the effects of the method on detection treetop, we compared the detection accuracy with two models combining two equations respectively. Our experiment region is the campus of Beijing Forestry University, the surface coverage of which is significant complicatedly on ground. At the end, we compared the distance of three weighted centroid points calculated by three weighted method to true tree-tops to evaluate the accuracy of tree location. The result indicated that using green channel value as weight method to calculate tree crown centroid can get higher accuracy than the other two ones, whose one to one relationship accuracy value is up to 85% and commission error reaches to 15% and omission error is 23%. Our work uses several typical image processing methods to extract the tree area in the urban area of mixed coniferous broad leaf forest and calculate the centroid of tree crowns using three weighted value so as to obtain the precious position coordinate information of each tree. In future, final geography coordinate of each tree location derived from this experiment will be regard as unique identification in creating an individual database which provides a feasible idea for future urban tree-level management. © 2020 ACM.},

	abstract = {Urban forests can provide vital environmental and social functions if appropriately planned and managed. Tree inventory and tree dimensions are an important part of evaluating and monitoring the growth, size and health condition of urban trees. Accordingly, crown diameter (cd), height (h) and diameter at breast height (dbh) are significant biometric descriptors of tree size and bulk. When making decisions regarding urban environments it is important to be able to properly estimate these descriptors which are also needed to evaluate for example the so-called zones of upheaval (i.e., areas of interaction between roots and hard surfaces) and soil volume needs for planting trees in urban areas as well as for estimating their growth, control of diseases and preservation requirements. In line with the above, the scope of this contribution is that of assessing the relationship (via direct field measurements and regression analysis) that exists between the dbh of a given tree species relative to its h and cd. This information can be of assistance when substantiating tree measurements determined via existing mobile mapping technology systems. One hundred and three mature Norfolk Island pine trees (Araucaria heterophilla) located along a tourist shoreline of the Gold Coast (Queensland, Australia) were selected for this work. Their h, cd and dbh were individually measured, processed, and mapped in terms of their coordinate locations (i.e., latitude and longitude). Tree data was captured via field surveys using a diameter tape for dbh, and a laser range finder for measuring tree h and cd. A GNSS enabled digital camera was used to collect pictorial information and location description. For the case study investigated here, the regression models of h=F(dbh) and cd=F(dbh) reasonably validated (R2=0.928 and R2=0.899 respectively) the Australian standard estimates of h and cd of ornamental trees based on their dbh, thus making these estimates easier to determine via simplified mathematical functions. This is because the dbh is easier to be measured accurately in the field as compared to h and cd, and it can also provide information regarding the biomass, volume and carbon storage of trees. © Author(s) 2023.

	abstract = {Anthropogenic change, particularly in urban landscapes, has resulted in the fragmentation of indigenous vegetation into often small isolated 'remnants'. The persistence of arboreal fauna in small urban remnants in part depends on the distribution and abundance of habitat resources within the remnant. We surveyed 44 small (<2.5 ha) eucalypt remnants located within the south-eastern suburbs of metropolitan Melbourne to ascertain the abundance of hollow-bearing trees, an important ecological resource. The probability of a live or dead tree containing a hollow was investigated in relation to site variables that influenced exposure to wind, a factor thought to increase the propensity of hollow formation in eucalypt trees. A total of 2678 live and 224 dead eucalypt trees were surveyed, of which 350 live (12%) and 70 dead (31%) trees were hollow-bearing. The probability of a tree being hollow-bearing was strongly positively associated with the diameter of the tree, however, past management practices have lead to a paucity of large (>80 cm DBH) trees in small urban remnants. We found that variables that measured exposure to wind were correlated with the chance that a live tree will be hollow-bearing while reducing the chance that a dead tree will be hollow-bearing. Although highly variable, the number of hollow-bearing trees contained within small urban remnants (mean of 5.8 ha-1) fell well below that contained in areas of un-logged non-urban forest. Our results indicated that large numbers of hollow-bearing tree are unlikely to be recruited into urban remnants for a significant time-span and as such there is an increased importance placed on maintaining the current inventory of hollow-bearing trees for the maintenance of biodiversity in urban areas. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {The future trajectory of fossil fuel emissions is one of the largest uncertainties in predicting climate change. While global emissions scenarios are ultimately of interest for climate modeling, many of the factors that influence energy and fuel consumption operate on a local rather than global level. However, there have been relatively few comprehensive studies of the ecological and socioeconomic processes that will determine the future trajectory of net carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions at local and regional scales. We conducted an interdisciplinary, whole ecosystem study of the role of climate, urban expansion, urban form, transportation, and the urban forest in influencing net CO2 emissions in the Salt Lake Valley, Utah, a rapidly urbanizing region in the western U.S. Our approach involved a detailed emissions inventory validated with atmospheric measurements, as well as a system dynamics model of future CO2 emissions developed in collaboration with local stakeholders. The model highlighted the importance of a positive feedback between urban land development and transportation investments that may strongly affect emissions by amplifying declines in developmental densities and increases in vehicular traffic. Simulations suggested that while doubling the density of tree planting would have a negligible effect on total urban CO2 emissions, land use and transportation policies that dampen the intensity of the urban sprawl feedback could result in a 22% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030 relative to a business as usual scenario. We suggest that by advancing our mechanistic understanding of energy and fuel consumption regionally, this urban ecosystem approach has great potential for improving emissions scenario studies if replicated in other cities and urbanizing regions. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Trees are important components of urban greenery because of their large stature and longevity, and their ability to enhance the environmental quality of city landscapes. However, benefits and hazards associated with trees depend on their size, which changes over time and varies among species. While urban trees are often measured during routine management, the full value of these data is rarely realised. Our study uses nation-wide inspection records from Singapore to develop allometric models for 54 species grown in the urban tropics (n = 345 794), a region that is poorly represented in allometric literature. We use the height-diameter relationship to demonstrate how analyses of existing datasets can be used to support decisions on tree inspection and maintenance. The accuracy of models developed separately for each species (single-species models) and using the pooled data for all species (mixed-effects model) was compared. Model outputs and derived metrics were used to detect height outliers and priority regions that may require greater inspection effort, which we summarise using spatial visualisations and an online web application. Model parameters also varied according to each species' pruning intensity and maximum height, and can thus provide a useful heuristic when selecting species to plant. Such data-driven approaches have the potential to support both management and research, though changes to workflows may be needed to take advantage of new sources of data. Integrating multiple datasets into decision-making will require expertise across multiple disciplines, and coordinated action among stakeholders. By sharing the code used to develop the allometric models in a new open-source R package 'allometree', we hope to promote reproducibility and facilitate the application of allometric equations to other tree parameters, study regions and management objectives. © 2020 The Author(s).

	abstract = {In urban ecosystems, tree cavities provide critical habitat for a variety of wildlife, and their occurrence is influenced by tree health, management, and cavity excavators. Changes over time in vegetative structure, human use patterns, and built environment affect the formation and persistence of tree cavities, and these changes may differ in various urban habitats. Trees with some decay are often associated with tree cavities, however, parks and residential habitats which are highly managed often lack highly-decayed trees, and large trees which are dead and damaged are likely to be removed and replaced with saplings. We surveyed changes over seven years (in 2013 and 2020) in the abundance of both excavated woodpecker cavities and decay cavities, in three urban habitats (forest, park, and residential) in the Chicago region, IL, USA. We observed greater stability of cavity abundance in managed park and residential habitats over time. Low numbers of highly-decayed trees in park and residential habitats were associated with reduced excavated cavity presence compared to forests. As expected, in both 2013 and 2020, the probability of cavity presence for both excavated and decay cavities was increased with greater tree size and higher levels of tree decay, though the patterns of this association varied between habitat types and years. The continued replacement and maintenance of existing trees means that managed park and residential habitats were more stable than unmanaged forest remnants, which are vulnerable to large changes in tree characteristics which could foster unpredictable booms or busts in cavity supply. A stable inventory of tree-cavities depends on preserving large trees, and decay of urban trees benefits habitat quality for cavity-nesters. Pruning of branches or removal of dead trees curtails the life-cycle of tree cavities in decayed branches, so that more highly managed habitats contain fewer cavities than the number of trees could potentially support. Cavity abundance could be improved in stable habitats through reduced intervention where safe, allowing cavity development to occur in situ. © 2023 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {Remote sensing technologies have been increasingly crucial to support policy-makers in achieving their ecological strategies. The data provided by such technology can estimate the bioenergy source production rate and monitor deforestation. This work participates in the cause by contributing an aerial dataset and developing an intelligent tree-detection system usable for counting trees with the bioenergy potential. Low-altitude flying units have been vastly used for such a purpose due to their ability to capture high-quality data from distant locations. Despite these potentials, collected images that compose a dataset are often characterized by imbalanced distribution among classes. The class disproportion can affect the overall model performance, as it severely deprives key features of under-represented classes. This study proposes data-level approaches that adopt and extend prior sampling algorithms for object detection problems. The devised techniques try to reduce the number of redundant outputs obtained from sampling methods and reduce the iteration required to achieve the target imbalance ratio by employing a systematic flow. In such a process, the class distribution of an original dataset is used as a guideline for selecting candidates for subsequent processes. Our results show that the modified dataset can reduce the length of a training process shown by fewer iterations required to achieve the final metrics of its original dataset version and lower training losses in each iteration. Additionally, the modified dataset can improve the F-score ((Formula presented.)) and precision metric of object detection algorithm by up to 6%. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {This research seeks to answer the question, what factors of the urban social-ecological system predict survival and growth of trees in nonprofit and neighborhood tree-planting projects? The Ostrom social-ecological system framework and Clark and colleagues' model of urban forest sustainability inform our selection of variables in four categories in the social-ecological system; these categories are the trees, the biophysical environment, the community, and management institutions. We use tree inventory methods to collect data on the survival, growth, and the social-ecological growing environment of recently-planted street trees in Indianapolis, IN to answer our research question. We use a probit model to predict tree survival, and a linear regression model to predict tree growth rate. The following variables are positively related to tree success (survival and/or growth): ball-and-burlap or container packaging, a visible root flare, good overall condition rating, the size of the tree-planting project, planting area width, median household income, percent of renter occupied homes, resident tenure, prior tree planting experience, correct mulching, and a collective watering strategy. The following variables are negatively related to tree success: caliper at planting, crown dieback, and lower trunk damage. Additional variables measured have less clear connections to tree success and should be examined further. Given that models including variables from all four categories of the social-ecological system generally outperform models that exclude some components, we recommend that future research on urban tree survival and growth should consider the holistic social-ecological systems context of the urban ecosystem. © 2014 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Trees are essential to urban habitats because they provide services that benefit the environment and improve human health. Unfortunately, urban trees often have more herbivorous insect pests than rural trees but the mechanisms and consequences of these infestations are not well documented. Here, we examine how temperature affects the abundance of a scale insect, Melanaspis tenebricosa (Comstock) (Hemiptera: Diaspididae), on one of the most commonly planted street trees in the eastern U.S. Next, we examine how both pest abundance and temperature are associated with water stress, growth, and condition of 26 urban street trees. Although trees in the warmest urban sites grew the most, they were more water stressed and in worse condition than trees in cooler sites. Our analyses indicate that visible declines in tree condition were best explained by scale-insect infestation rather than temperature. To test the broader relevance of these results, we extend our analysis to a database of more than 2700 Raleigh, US street trees. Plotting these trees on a Landsat thermal image of Raleigh, we found that warmer sites had over 70% more trees in poor condition than those in cooler sites. Our results support previous studies linking warmer urban habitats to greater pest abundance and extend this association to show its effect on street tree condition. Our results suggest that street tree condition and ecosystem services may decline as urban expansion and global warming exacerbate the urban heat island effect. Although our non-probability sampling method limits our scope of inference, our results present a gloomy outlook for urban forests and emphasize the need for management tools. Existing urban tree inventories and thermal maps could be used to identify species that would be most suitable for urban conditions. © 2014 Dale, Frank.},

For these estimates to be successful, there is a need both for accurate quantification of urban tree populations and structure, and consideration of the net carbon sequestered when the fate of wood waste is factored in. This study provides a novel approach to providing a full city tree inventory for the city of Meran in northern Italy, using a combination of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and field techniques. Allometric equations, and the i-Tree application quantified the carbon storage in Meran as 8923 and 9213 Mg respectively, with an average carbon storage of 13.5 t/ha (5.47 kg C/m2). The percentage of traffic emissions sequestered annually is 0.61% falling to 0.17% when all emissions are considered. Differences between end-of-life wood management techniques were revealed, with burning with energy recovery for electricity being the most efficient with a carbon emissions/input ratio of 0.5. Landfill was the least efficient with a ratio of 121.9. The fate of this end-of-life wood has significant implications for carbon budget calculations in cities worldwide. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Ecological corridors and urban parks are created to connect habitats that become isolated due to urban development and integrate ecological, social, and cultural functions. Establishing and implementing the ecological function of urban green structures and conservation plans for urban terrestrial species requires prioritizing developing an understanding of the community structure of urban terrestrial species. However, understanding the appearance and distribution of terrestrial species in urban ecosystems is often neglected or lacking; furthermore, the inaccurate detection of species distribution can create biased estimates of species occupancy. Recently, an applied research method for detecting terrestrial species such as mammals and birds has been proposed based on molecular biology such as environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding. We installed artificial water tanks (mesocosm) in urban green spaces (Urban forests; UFs, Urban ecological corridors; UECs, Urban parks; UPs), applying eDNA metabarcoding as a tool to detect wild terrestrial species, and camera traps (CTs) and field surveys were performed in parallel to verify the results. We detected 22 urban terrestrial species only by eDNA metabarcoding and identified 43 species in total by performing eDNA metabarcoding, CTs, and field surveys in parallel. In addition, we identified 31 species of UFs, 13 species of UECs, and 28 species of UPs of urban terrestrial species using the three species survey methods in parallel. We confirmed that eDNA metabarcoding is very useful for detecting small species that are difficult to detect with the naked eye and internal species vulnerable to disturbance. However, since some species were only detected by CTs or field surveys due to DNA false-negative errors or the species’ life-history characteristics, it was judged that the species inventory can be effectively collected using several monitoring techniques. © 2022 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study seeks to answer the question, "Will the Million Trees LA (Million Trees Los Angeles, MTLA) program be a carbon dioxide (CO 2) sink or source?" Because there has never been a full accounting of CO2 emissions, it is unclear if urban tree planting initiatives (TPIs) are likely to be effective means for reaching local reduction targets. Methods: Using surveys, interviews, field sampling, and computer simulation of tree growth and survival over a 40-year time period, we developed the first process-based life cycle inventory of CO2 for a large TPI. CO2 emissions and reductions from storage and avoided emissions from energy savings were simulated for 91,786 trees planted from 2006 to 2010, of which only 30,813 (33.6 %) were estimated to survive. Results and discussion: The MTLA program was estimated to release 17,048 and 66,360 t of fossil and biogenic CO2 over the 40-year period, respectively. The total amount emitted (83,408 t) was slightly more than the -77,942 t CO2 that trees were projected to store in their biomass. The MTLA program will be a CO2 sink if projected 40-year-avoided fossil fuel CO2 emissions from energy savings (-101,679 t) and biopower (-1,939 t) are realized. The largest sources of CO2 emissions were mulch decomposition (65.1 %), wood combustion (14.5 %), and irrigation water (9.7 %). Conclusions: Although trees planted by the MTLA program are likely to be a net CO2 sink, there is ample opportunity to reduce emissions. Examples of these opportunities include selecting drought-tolerant trees and utilizing wood residue to generate electricity rather than producing mulch. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.},

A census and analysis of the tree composition in the green areas was carried out. A tree population composed of 391 individuals belonging to 19 families and 34 species was determined. The most common species were Ficus benjamina (23 %), Schinus molle (13.8 %), Hesperocyparis lusitanica (10.2 %), and Ligustrum lucidum (10 %). Simpson's index (1-D) had a value of 0.73, and the Shannon-Wiener index (H') equaled 3.89, which indicates a high diversity. The three most abundant species recorded do not comply with 10-20-30 rule.

	abstract = {This study was an investigation into the carbon storage and sequestration of trees grown in the green spaces of Kolhapur city, Maharashtra. Urban gardens and green spaces, mainly considering big trees, have a great potential to sequester carbon from the atmosphere and to mitigate the impacts of climate change in cities. Total ten green pockets (gardens) were selected from Kolhapur city. This study was a sustainability initiative to inventory tree species from the green pockets and to assess their carbon sequestration potential for improved urban planning in the future. The above ground biomass (AGB) and below ground biomass (BGB) were estimated by a non destructive method. This included the measurement of tree height and diameter. A total of 29 species of trees were recorded during the study with a storage potential of 688.77 tons of carbon dioxide. Polyalthia longifolia was found to sequester maximum carbon dioxide (CO2) followed by Albizia saman and Mangifera indica. This research highlights the role of urban forests or green spaces and gardens, not only as ornamental and aesthetic plantations but also for mitigating the impacts of climate change at a local level. Well planned urban spaces and urban trees have a major role as green vegetation cover which can act as a carbon sink with high potential which will help in policy making and decision making in the future.  © 2023 Priya R.

	abstract = {Habitat loss via urbanization is a cause of decline for reptile and amphibian species around the world. The Atlantic Forest is the second largest rainforest of South America and holds one of the most extraordinary herpetofauna in the world, even after decades of fragmentation. The Parque Estadual das Fontes do Ipiranga (PEFI) is one of the most important remnants of Atlantic Forest inside the city of São Paulo (Brazil), but its herpetofauna richness has not been studied. Between 2011 and 2014, we carried out a herpetofaunal inventory in the PEFI and made notes on habitat use by using pitfall traps with drift fences combined with acoustic and visual encounter surveys. We also collected data from opportunistic encounters and historical information from scientific collections. We found that the PEFI harbors 22 native species of anurans, 24 native species of reptiles, and three exotic species of reptiles. Also, through surveying scientific collections, we found three species of amphibians and one of the snakes that were detected in the past but were not detected during our survey. The composition of amphibian species in the PEFI is similar to proximal small urban and periurban Atlantic Forest fragments, but its species richness is higher than these fragments even when compared to areas with similar or larger size. In conclusion, the highly urban PEFI supports considerable herpetofaunal diversity in comparison with other regional areas and our data reinforce the necessity of conserving this and other urban forest fragments through strategic management across the Atlantic Forest. © 2021.},

Medit. 27: 195-220. 2017. — ISSN: 1120-4052 printed, 2240-4538 online.; Mediterranean urban areas house substantial amounts of biodiversity – both plant and animal. Urban green spaces include (a) areas of natural or semi-natural vegetation such as ecosystem fragments, reserves, nature parks, forests, and river banks, which house varying amounts of native species; (b) urban agriculture and horticulture; (c) managed spaces with cultivated vegetation such as parks and gardens; and (d) informal urban green spaces such as wastelands or brown field sites which are largely colonized by weeds, ruderal plants and invasive species. Considerable attention has been paid to the biodiversity values of the first two categories but the last category which includes areas such as industrial wastelands, roadside verges, river and canal banks, railway line embankments, has been largely neglected. The benign climate of the Mediterranean region has permitted the cultivation of a wide range of both temperate and semitropical trees, shrubs and herbaceous plants in parks, gardens and other urban settings. The main managed elements are public parks, private and domestic gardens, botanic gardens, zoological parks, glasshouses and shade houses, planted urban forests, street trees, landscaping of office blocks, residential apartment blocks, public buildings, university and college campuses, business parks, golf courses, nurseries, garden centres, and more recently green roofs and living walls. While the diversity of species grown in urban botanic gardens is usually well documented, we have little detailed information on the overall range of species grown in public parks and gardens and, with some exceptions, even less of those grown in private gardens. Street trees are an important component of urban diversity with more than 55% of streets in a city like Madrid populated with trees, totalling altogether 300,000 specimens. Many cities have published guides to their urban street trees but there is no overall compilation. Overall, it is likely that altogether several tens of thousands of plant species are grown in Mediterranean urban areas, representing a very substantial source of biodiversity. The inventory of urban plant diversity is very uneven: for some cities such as Ioannina, Jerusalem, Montpellier, Naples, Patras, Rome, Sousse, fairly comprehensive inventories have been compiled but for most our knowledge is incomplete. Given the large growing percentage of city dwellers in the Mediterranean, it is important that much more attention should be paid to understanding and maintaining urban plant diversity which contributes substantially to human health and wellbeing.},

	abstract = {Quantifying urban tree biomass and carbon (C) storage by using allometric equations is required for various studies such as assessing the inventory, modelling, and measuring ecosystem services of urban trees. However, the lack of urban-specific allometric equations leads to uncertainty when estimating urban tree biomass and C storage. Therefore, we followed a nondestructive approach and developed allometric equations specifically for Acer buergerianum Miq., Ginkgo biloba L., Platanus orientalis L., Prunus yedoensis Matsum., and Zelkova serrata (Thunb.) Makino in Daegu, Korea. Diameter at breast height (DBH)-based and DBH-and-height-based allometric equations were highly accurate at estimating the aboveground volume (R2>0.92), while the allometric equations for P. orientalis and Z. serrata developed for traditional forests overestimated volume by 68% and 427%, respectively. The addition of a height variable into the DBH-based allometric equations did not increase the reliability of the allometric equations at a local level. The mean aboveground C storage of urban street trees was 24.9 Mg C/ha except for P. orientalis with a mean of 69.7 Mg C/ha, and the total aboveground C storage of urban street trees in Daegu was 10.6Gg C. Alternatively, a generalized allometric equation which compiled species-specific equations can be applied for large-scale estimation. The generalized equations developed in this study and those found in the literature may suggest a constant value (~2.3-2.4) for the scaling exponent in the generalized equations. Allometric equations developed from natural or artificial stands may overestimate the volume of urban street trees; therefore, estimating urban tree biomass and C storage requires urban-specific allometric equations. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.},

	abstract = {Unlike exhaust emissions, non-exhaust traffic emissions are completely unregulated and in addition, there are large uncertainties in the non-exhaust emission factors required to estimate the emissions of these aerosols. This study provides the first published results of direct measurements of size resolved emission factors for particles in the size range 0.25-2.5 μm using a new approach to derive aerosol emission factors based on carbon dioxide (CO2) emission fluxes. Aerosol fluxes were measured over one year using the eddy covariance method at the top of a 105 m high communication tower in Stockholm, Sweden. Maximum CO2 and particle fluxes were found when the wind direction coincided with the area of densest traffic within the footprint area. Negative fluxes (uptake of CO2 and deposition of particles) coincided with periods of sampling from an urban forest area. The fluxes of CO2 were used to obtain emission factors for particles by assuming that the CO2 fluxes could be directly related to the amount of fuel burnt by vehicles in the footprint area. The estimated emission factor for the fleet mix in the measurement area was, in number 1.8 &times; 10 11 particle veh-1 kmg-1 (for 0.25-2.5 μm size range). Assuming spherical particles of density 1600 kg mg-3 this corresponds to 27.5 mg veh-1 kmg-1. For particles (0.8-2.5 μm) the emission factors were 5.1 109 veh-1 km -1 for number and 11.5 mg veh-1 kmg-1 for mass. But a wind speed dependence was noted for high wind speeds. Thus, for wind speeds larger than 9 m sg-1, as measured in the tower at 105 m (105), the emission factor for particle number and mass was parameterised as: f (Number, 0.8-2.5 μm) Combining double low line (6.1 ± 1.7)109 U 105 &minus;50 &plusmn; 188 and Ef (Mass, 0.8μndash;2.5 μm) Combining double low line (20 μ 12) 105 ± 171 ±122. © 2011 Author(s).},

	abstract = {Accurate leaf-mass determination is a critical factor in estimating the magnitude of biogenic hydrocarbon (BHC) emissions from green plants. In several past studies that developed BHC emissions estimates for urban areas, a volumetric approach was used to estimate leaf masses of urban trees. Crown volumes were modeled by geometric solids and then multiplied by species-specific leaf-mass constants (experimentally determined leaf mass-to-volume ratios) to obtain leaf mass, although associated uncertainties were not well characterized. The purpose of the present study was to examine the precision and accuracy of a volumetric approach using geometric solids to compare estimated leaf masses to measured whole-tree leaf masses, and to compare leaf-mass constants derived from selective sampling within crowns to whole-tree values. Accordingly, total leaf masses obtained through tree harvest and leaf removal of 21 urban trees were compared to leaf masses calculated using geometric solids to model the shapes of tree crowns and leaf-mass constants found in the literature. Leaf masses were also calculated from recently published allometric equations. Using the experimentally measured total leaf mass and dimensions of each tree, whole-tree leaf-mass constants were also calculated. Results from this study suggest that leaf-mass estimates developed for individual trees through a volumetric approach may be within ~50% of actual values. For the 21 trees in this study, sums of leaf-mass estimates were within ~20% of the sum of the measured leaf masses when the vertical ellipsoid, sphere, or preferred solids were used. Leaf masses per unit area of crown projection for these urban trees were greater than the values of leaf mass per ground surface area reported for eastern deciduous forests.},

GEMINI is a scientific project of the Faculty of Geodesy, University of Zagreb and Croatian Forest Research Institute funded by the Croatian science foundation. The project aims to explore new knowledge about the green infrastructure (GI) monitoring. The study area of the research is the capital of Croatia, the city of Zagreb. One of the main goals of the project is to explore the possibilities of data integration of all available remote sensing platforms: satellite, aerial and UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) imagery, terrestrial imagery and ground truth data. UAV-based remote sensing offers great possibilities to acquire field data for monitoring of GI within the urban areas in a fast and easy way. The main objective of this research is to establish an innovative, multidimensional system for monitoring of urban green infrastructure. It will integrate the latest means of data collection (multispectral satellite imagery improved and calibrated with high resolution terrestrial and airborne multispectral sources), advanced spatial analysis with the aim to improve decision support system for better management of urban GI. This project will improve the current state of the inventory and monitoring of the urban GI to support decision making and preservation of GI benefits, through the establishment of comprehensive procedures for integration of different sources of imagery at different resolution scales: satellite, terrestrial and airborne. This research will focus on novel methods for GI monitoring on the integration of different multispectral imagery sensors. It will require a highly multidisciplinary approach, leading to improvements in methods and procedures for automatic and semi-automatic processing of a large number of geospatial imagery data in the field of urban forest management with expected impact in forestry, arboriculture, urban and geospatial science. © SGEM2017.},

	abstract = {For some volunteers, neighborhood safety is one of the reasons for becoming involved in community greening. For example, many volunteers of the Community Greenspace program at the Urban Resources Initiative in New Haven, Connecticut believe that there is a potential reduction in crime from community greening activities, even though it is not an explicit goal of the program. These types of community-led interventions are distinct from both existing tree canopy and large-scale municipally led initiatives. These types of interventions remain understudied with respect to the potential for reducing crime. We therefore used a quasi-experimental difference-in-differences (DID) approach to test whether more than a decade of street tree planting (1996–2007) in New Haven had an effect on crime levels at planting sites (n = 300) compared to control sites that received no Community Greenspace-planted trees (n = 893). We examined violent, property, and misdemeanor crimes (comprised of vandalism, prostitution, and narcotics crimes) individually and jointly to test for crime-type specific effects, while controlling for sociodemographic factors and spatio-temporal trends. In general, we found a null relationship between trees planted and crime on block faces per year at the p < 0.05 level. Increases in crime were not observed on treatment sites. We discuss implications for tree inventories and monitoring, study design, and techniques to assess impacts of tree planting efforts. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Carbon sequestration coupled with flood mitigation and other functions of wetlands, such as water filtration, coastal protection, biodiversity, and providing recreational spots, make wetland mapping and monitoring important for different countries. Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform is becoming a very important tool for lots of environmental studies as it provides a suite of tools and access to data that facilitate large-scale environmental monitoring projects through its powerful parallel processing capabilities. In this study, we use GEE to access multi-source remote sensing datasets and implement an object-based image analysis, and random forest algorithm for the classification of wetlands in the state of Minnesota. Emergent, forested, and scrub-shrub wetland classes, water, as well as urban, forest, and agriculture land cover types were classified using Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1, USGS 3D Elevation Program 10-meter DEM, and gridded soil data. NDVI, EVI, BSI, NDBI, and NDWI spectral indices were calculated from Sentinel-2 imagery, VV and VH polarization channels, and their ratio, as well as span parameters, were calculated from Sentinel-1 imagery, and slope and aspect features were extracted from DEM. Simple Non-Iterative Clustering (SNIC), Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), Principal Components Analysis (PCA), and random forest algorithms were implemented to classify wetlands from the GEE platform. Emergent wetlands, water, urban, and agriculture classes performed well with producer accuracies greater than 90%. Sentinel-1, DEM, and soil datasets improve the identification of wetland classes and highlight the importance of multi-source approaches for wetland mapping.  © Authors 2022.},

	abstract = {                             Many managers have studied the afforestation as a mitigating tool for the problems caused by urbanization, since the specific knowledge of each municipality is fundamental for proper planning in relation to the species used, the number of trees and the location in the municipality. The present research had the objective of evaluating the spatial and biological diversity indexes of the road arborization of the city of Itanhaém - SP. For the accomplishment of the research, a qualitative and quantitative inventory of the arborization was done to obtain the coverage indices and tree density, index of full occupation, current occupation and the deficit of afforestation and the performance index of the species. There is 1 tree for each 100 m                             2                              of sidewalk in the municipality, 2.35% of the sidewalks are covered by the crown of the trees and the municipality presents only 21.1% of the ideal afforestation. The municipality had a high diversity index of Shannon H '= 3.45 and Simpson dominance λ = 0.082. The native species with the best performance index was Schinus terebinthifolius. Although there are species diversity in the municipality, the current situation demonstrates the scarcity of trees, indicating the need for intensification in the planting of trees in the road system.                          © 2019, Fundacao de Pesquisas Florestais do Parana.;                              Muitos gestores têm estudado a arborização como ferramenta mitigatória dos problemas causados pela urbanização, já que o conhecimento específico de cada município é fundamental para o planejamento adequado em relação as espécies utilizadas, a quantidade de árvores e a localização no município.

	abstract = {Atmospheric deposition of total mercury was studied at two sites in central Poland, between April 2013 and October 2014. Hg in rainwater (bulk deposition) was analyzed in relation to meteorological parameters and major ions (H+, NO3-, Cl-, SO42-) in order to investigate seasonal variation, identify sources and determine factors affecting atmospheric Hg chemistry and deposition. Total mercury concentrations varied between 1.24 and 22.1ngL-1 at the urban sampling site (Poznań) and between 0.57 and 18.3ngL-1 in the woodland protected area (Jeziory), with quite similar mean values of 6.96 and 6.37ngL-1, respectively. Mercury in precipitation exhibited lower spatial variability within the study domain (urban/forest transect) than the concentrations determined during other similar observations, reflecting the predominant influence of the same local sources. In our study, a significant seasonal pattern of Hg deposition was observed at both sampling sites, with higher and more variable concentrations of Hg reported for the urban area. In particular, deposition values of Hg were higher in the samples attributed to relatively large precipitation amounts in the summer and in those collected during the winter season (the result of higher contributions from combustion sources, i.e. intensive combustion of fossil fuels in residential and commercial boilers, individual power/heat-generating plants). In addition, a significant relationship between Hg concentration and precipitation amount was found while considering different types of wintertime samples (i.e. rain, snow and mixed precipitation). The analysis of backward trajectories showed that air masses arriving from polluted regions of western Europe and southern Poland largely affected the amount of Hg in rainwater. A seasonal variation in Hg deposition fluxes was also observed, with the maximum value of Hg in spring and minimum in winter. Our results indicated that rainwater Hg and, consequently, the wet deposition flux of Hg are related to seasonal differences in precipitation (type, intensity, amount) and the emission source. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This study presents a methodology for developing a high-resolution (2 m) urban tree canopy leaf area inventory in different tree phenological seasons and a subsequent application of the methodology to a 625 km2 urban area in Tokyo. Satellite remote sensing has the advantage of imaging large areas simultaneously. However, mapping the tree canopy cover and leaf area accurately is still difficult in a highly heterogeneous urban landscape. The WorldView-2/3 satellite imagery at the individual tree level (2 m resolution) was used to map urban trees based on a simple pixel-based classification method. The comparison of our mapping results with the tree canopy cover derived from aerial photography shows that the error margin is within an acceptable range of 5.5% at the 3.0 km2 small district level, 5.0% at the 60.9 km2 municipality level, and 1.2% at the 625 km2 city level. Furthermore, we investigated the relationship between the satellite data (vegetation index) and in situ tree-measurement data (leaf area index) to develop a simple model to directly map the tree leaf area from theWorldView-2/3 imagery. The estimated total leaf area in Tokyo urban area in the leaf-on season (633 km2) was twice that of the leaf-offseason (319 km2). Our results also showed that the estimated total leaf area in Tokyo urban area was 1.9-6.2 times higher than the results of the moderate-resolution (30 m) satellite imagery. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The ability of urban woodlands to regenerate and provide ecosystem services depends on the maintenance of a range of ecosystem functions and processes (i.e. multifunctionality). Many conservation decisions are made by local land stewards and rely on taxonomic characterization of woodlands to infer ecosystem properties, but there is reason to doubt this approach. Can functional traits provide better information on ecosystem multifunctionality? We compare three methods for capturing differences in urban woodland multifunctionality. We ask whether differences in (1) species composition, (2) traits associated with urbanization (urbanization markers) or (3) traits associated with specific ecosystem properties (functional markers) best capture actual differences in colonisation, water infiltration and decomposition in woodlands across a rural-urban gradient (Montreal, Canada). We use Procrustes superimposition and Mantel tests to compare the fit of each method. We propose the functional Mahalanobis distance to measure the distance of an urban woodland from a reference range of multifunctionality. All three methods were significantly congruent with actual differences in ecosystem multifunctionality, but the strength of the rank-order correlations varied widely. Species composition and urbanization markers had a similar but weak correlation with differences in multifunctionality. Importantly, the mismatch between species composition and multifunctionality increased with urbanization. Functional markers captured ecosystem multifunctionality better than either species composition or urbanization markers. Commonly used species- and general trait-based approaches were poor measures for multifunctionality in our urban woodlands. Functional markers rely on vegetation inventories already routinely collected by land stewards and openly available trait information: they may provide a cost-effective way of capturing multifunctionality in urban systems. More broadly, the functional Mahalanobis distance provides a quantitative measure of site-level multifunctionality that allows land stewards to compare woodlands with a reference range of variability in a format that can directly inform conservation decisions. © 2021},

Samplings during dry and wet seasons were carried out in order to establish if seasonality influences species richness and complementarily of the spider fauna. Pitfall traps, nocturnal collections, and beating tray samples were used to access a multi-guild spider fauna. Spider species were estimated using first order Jackknife method. Four hundred samples were obtained, resulting in 1681 adult spiders. A total of 166 species were recorded and 211 were estimated. No significant differences for species richness were observed between both periods, and the captured species were the same according to the complementarily coefficients. The fragmentation hypothesis as factor of biota impoverishment was not tested, but future investigations on this topic are suggested in the complex of forest remnants in João Pessoa. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2006.},
